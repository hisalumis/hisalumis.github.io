Conclusion: What is creativity and what can it do for us?
Creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, concepts, or solutions to problems. It can be used for good or bad. The good side of creativity is that it can help us come up with new ideas, solutions, and ways to improve our lives.

What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of creating new and useful products or services. Innovation can be found in both traditional businesses and startups. A business that is constantly innovating will likely have a higher chance for success than one that is not as innovative. In order to be successful, a business must provide value to its customers and compete with other companies on a regular basis. A startup, on the other hand, does not have the same constraints as a traditional company and can often be more creative in their product development.
