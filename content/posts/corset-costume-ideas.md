The brainstroming phenomenon is a type of333 mindreading that occurs when a person’s thoughts and ideas are gathered and analyzed in a very condensed way. Brainstroming is often used in business, marketing, and strategic planning to understand how people are thinking and what they would be willing to do. It can also be used as a tool for improving creativity, problem solving, and decision making. There are many different ways that brainstroming can be used, but the basic principle is the same: you collect data in a very concise way so that you can understand how it relates to your current situation or idea.

Definition of innovation:
Innovation is the process of creating new products or services that are better than those currently available. It can be defined in many ways, but one way to think of it is as the change in direction of a product or service over time. Innovation can come from a company owner who decides to bring a new idea to market, as well as from employees who come up with new ways to do things that improve productivity or customer satisfaction.

The 4 types of ideas: creative, critical, problem-solving, and emotional
Creative ideas are always intoxicating, and can be a great way to get your creative juices flowing. However, it's important to be careful with what you create – too much creativity can lead to problems. Here are four types of ideas that can help you get your creative juices flowing: problem-solving ideas, emotional ideas, and critical ideas.
Problem-solving Ideas: 
1) Come up with ways to make the existing structure of your business more efficient or effective. This could mean finding ways to cut costs or improve efficiency, or coming up with new ways to appeal to customers. 
2) Use your creativity in order to come up with solutions to problems that have been bothering your customers for years. For example, if you're a restaurant, come up with new menu items that appeal specifically to people who are struggling financially.
