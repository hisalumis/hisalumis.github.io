How to turn creative ideas into reality
Creative ideas are a dime a dozen, but sometimes they can turn into something really great. Here are four tips to help you turn your creative ideas into reality:
1. Have a vision. Without a clear vision, it’s tough to put together an idea that will work. Make sure your idea is based on something you care about and have passion for.

2. Get feedback. Take the time to get feedback from people who know what you’re talking about. Not only will this help you ensure your idea is accurate, but it can also give you some great ideas to work with.

3. Make it simple and achievable. If it’s too difficult or challenging to come up with an idea, chances are it won’t be successful.

What is invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, product, or service that was not previously thought of. Inventions can come in many forms, from small ideas to huge leaps in technology. Some inventions are so important that they have changed the way the world works, such as the computer and telephone. Others are simply bizarre, like a Bob-omb that can walk and talk.
