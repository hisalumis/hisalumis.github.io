Eco-Friendly Home Improvements: How can you make your home more eco-friendly?
Eco-friendly home improvements are easy to make if you take the time to think about what you need and want. Here are a few ideas to help make your home more eco-friendly:
1. Make sure your heating and cooling system is eco-friendly. Not only will this save you money in the long run, but it can also help improve your environment by reducing emissions from your home.

2. Use recycled materials in your construction. When building or repairing your home, be sure to use recycled materials whenever possible. This not only saves you money in the long run, but it also helps reduce environmental impact on both of our planetâ€™s inhabitants and future generations.

3. Use rainwater tanks rather than water systems that use water fluoridation products.
