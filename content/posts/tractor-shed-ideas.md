Invention ideas can be anything from a new way to make a product or service more efficient, to a better way to store food. Sometimes, the best ideas come from scratch â€“ when an inventor has a great idea for something that nobody else has thought of. For example, in the medical world, many people are still surprised by how often diseases sneak up on people unawares.
