Invention: The history of invention
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, whether it is a new product, service or technology. It has been around for centuries and has had a wide variety of outcomes. 
One of the earliest examples of invention was in 100 BC when two brothers, Eudoxus and Philoctetes, came up with the idea of writing. They were the first to patent their invention and it soon became a household word. 

Inventions have also been used for military purposes. The world’s first anti-tank grenade was created by Raphael Salomon in 1795 and it was used in World War 1 to help destroy German tanks. 

Today, innovation continues to play an important role in our lives. There are many different ways that innovation can be used to create new products, services and technologies.

legal aspects of Invention: What are the rules surrounding invention?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new idea,product or method. It can be defined in many ways, but the most common definition is that invention is "the creation of something new out of nothing." Many countries have laws that regulate the creation and use of inventions. In some cases, these laws are more important than others, and they can play a decisive role in whether an invention becomes a commercial success.
There are three types of law governing invention: trade secrets, copyrights and patents.trade secrets usually relate to technology or business ideas, while copyrights protect creative works such as novels, motion pictures and computer programs. Patents allow inventors to exclusive use their ideas for a period of time, which can make it difficult for other people to adopt or use an invention.

Creative problem-solving:
Creative problem-solving is a key part of any creative person’s toolbox. By solving problems, you can produce high-quality work. Here are a few tips to help you explore and solve creative problems:
1) Do your research before you start anything. When starting something new, it’s helpful to know what others have done and how they’ve solved similar problems. This will give you an idea of how to approach the problem and what steps should be taken next.

2) Take your time. Don’t try to do too much at once. If you hurry, you might not get the results that you want or need. Time allows for moreassing thought and creates a better atmosphere for creativity.

3) Be patient. Don’t expect everything to go as planned the first time around.
