What is Invention?
Invention, especially in the modern world, is a process of coming up with a new idea or product that has not been thought of before. Invention can come from anywhere, but it is usually most productive when it comes from within the company or team that is working on the product or service. Inventions have the potential to change the way people live and work, and they have also helped to bring about advances in technology and science.
