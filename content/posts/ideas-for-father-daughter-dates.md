Overcoming creative blocks.
Creativity is a trait that is often associated with artists, musicians, and other professionals in the arts. However, creativity is not just a talent that only these people possess. Everyone has the ability to be creative, but sometimes we can get stuck in a rut and find it difficult to be creative. If you're feeling uninspired, here are a few tips to help you overcome your creative block.

Go for a walk, watch a movie, or read a book. When you come back to your project, you'll have fresh eyes and a new perspective.

2. Talk to other people about your project.
