What is the definition of invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new product or service that never existed before. Invention can come from anything, from a simple idea to a novel technology. Some inventions are so important that they have led to entire industries, such as antibiotics and jet engines. Others are more mundane, like improved rice varieties or new ways to store gasoline. Regardless of the invention's importance, it is always amazing when someone comes up with a new way to do something.

If you're looking to boost your brainstroming skills, here are a few tips to get you started.
