What is brainstroming?
Are you finding it hard to focus on your work? Are you feeling overwhelmed by all the information you have to remember? If so, you might be experiencing brainstroming, or an intense focus on one task that is preventing you from completing other tasks. Brainstroming is a common problem and can lead to a loss of time and productivity. Here are some tips to help keep your mind active and focused: 
-Set specific goals for yourself and work towards them as closely as possible. This will help keep your focus on task and not onfailed goals. 
-Keep a positive attitude when working with new information. This will help prevent brainstroming and allow you to pay more attention to the task at hand. 
-Stay organized by creating lists of information, breaking down complex concepts into manageable chunks, and tracking progress.

The different types of ideas: What are the different types of ideas?
Ideas are everything. They give people a way to think about problems and come up with solutions. It can be difficult to come up with ideas, but with some effort, anyone can create something new. There are many different types of ideas, but here are four that are particularly useful for business:
1. Problem-solving: When you have a problem, you need to come up with a solution. One of the best ways to do this is by thinking about the problem and coming up with ideas on how to solve it. You might come up with a plan or an idea on how to solve it, or you might just have some creative neurons firing and come up with an amazing solution!

2. Innovation: When you’re looking for new ideas, it’s important to think outside the box.
