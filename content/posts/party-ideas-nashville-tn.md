Defining "big ideas"
What are "big ideas"? This is a question that has been asked throughout the history of education. The answer, however, is not always so clear.
One way to think of big ideas is as concepts that are essential for understanding a particular subject. For example, in mathematics, some big ideas include numbers and operations, patterns and relationships, and geometry and measurement. In science, some big ideas include energy and matter, waves and forces, and Earth and space.

The National Education Association's College and Career Readiness Standards also identify several big ideas in each content area. For example, in English Language Arts, the standards identify reading for knowledge and information; reading for literary experience; writing; speaking and listening; and language. In history/social studies, the standards identify civics and government; economics; geography; history;and social studies skills and methods.
