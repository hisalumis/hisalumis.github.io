The history of brainstorming
In the late 1940s, a group of psychologists working at Yale University began to study what is now known as brainstorming. The team, led by George Prince, was interested in finding out whether people could come up with more ideas if they worked on their own or in groups.
The psychologists conducted a series of experiments in which participants were asked to come up with as many ideas as possible for different topics. They found that people who worked on their own came up with fewer ideas than those who worked in groups.

The psychologists also found that the quality of the ideas generated was better when people worked in groups. This is because people are able to build on each other's ideas and come up with new and better ideas as a result.

The findings of the Yale study sparked a lot of interest in the idea of brainstorming and its potential benefits.

What are some of the most common pitfalls when it comes to new ideas?
New ideas are always risky, so it’s important to be aware of some of the most common pitfalls when it comes to coming up with them. These include: not being able to see the potential positives, overestimating how much work is required, failing to anticipate resistance from others, and underestimating how much feedback is needed before anything can be put into practice. If you’re ever feeling lost when it comes to creating new ideas, take a step back and think about what worked for others before you try something new.
