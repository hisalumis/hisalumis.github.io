The future of creative art: What changes are likely to occur in the future and why?
Creative art has been around for centuries and is a key part of many cultures. However, with the advent of new technologies and an ever-growing population, the future of creative art is uncertain. Some experts predict that creativity will become more subdued and that it will be replaced by more factual or technological-based art. Others predict that creativity will continue to thrive and that it will be used in more creative ways. There are many potential reasons why this may happen, but one thing is for sure: the future of creative art is still largely unknown.
