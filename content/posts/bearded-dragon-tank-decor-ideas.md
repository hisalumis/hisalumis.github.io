The power of creativity: How can creativity help you achieve success?
Creativity is a necessary part of any successful business. Whether it’s coming up with new ideas for products or services, or coming up with new ways to reach your target market, creativity is essential to success. But what exactly is creativity? And how can it help you achieve success?
Creativity comes from the ability to come up with new ideas and concepts. It can be used to come up with fresh ways to approach problems, or to come up with new solutions to problems. It can also be used in order to improve productivity, or in order to increase sales.

But the most important thing about creativity is that it should be used in a positive way. It should not just be used as an outlet for negative emotions, but rather it should be used in order to help you achieve success.

Invention is the process of creating something new, whether it is a product, a process, or a solution to a problem. Inventors are those who come up with new ideas and turn them into reality. The invention process often begins with an idea, which is then developed through research and experimentation. Once an invention is created, it must be patented to protect the inventor's rights.

How do you come up with big ideas?
One of the best ways to come up with big ideas is by brainstorming. By thinking about possible solutions and possibilities, you can come up with concepts that may be even more interesting or challenging than what you currently think. Sometimes all it takes is some fresh creativity to inspire something new. So how do you go about brainstorming ideas? There are a few different methods, but the most important thing is to keep your ideas as accessible as possible so that everyone can contribute their own unique insights. Here are five ways: 
1) Take a walk around your neighborhood and see what local businesses are doing that could be applied to your city or town. This will give you a lot of potential inspirations for new ideas. 
2) Brainstorm with someone who knows more than you about a specific topic or problem.
