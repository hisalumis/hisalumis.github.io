The Three Types of Ideas: What are they and how should you use them?
Ideas are a type of ammunition that can be used to improve a person's productivity, creativity and overall outlook. There are three main types of ideas: operational, problem-solving and innovative.
Operational ideas involve tasks that can be completed quickly and easily. These include things like fixing a car or getting the cat out of the dog's toy box. Problem-solving ideas involve taking several steps in order to find a solution to a problem. These include solving an equation for example, or figuring out how to make something work better. Inventive ideas involve coming up with new ways to do something, or finding an old way of doing something and adapting it to new circumstances.

Introduce the topic of inventions.
Invention ideas are everywhere, and it can be hard to know where to start. Here are a few tips on how to come up with invention ideas that could make your life easier.

The creative process starts by sorting through all of the options and trying to find the best one for the project at hand. Next, the team needs to come up with a rough plan for how they will execute the idea. Once everything is set in stone, it’s time for creativity to take over!
