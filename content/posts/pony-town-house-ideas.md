Basic Tips for Doing a Better Job: Be sure to follow these Basic Tips before starting any DIY project, and you'll get the job done right.
If you're looking to improve your DIY skills, there are a few things you should keep in mind before beginning any project. Here are some basic tips to help you get started: 
1) Follow the instructions thoroughly - if something isn't working correctly, take it to someone who knows more about it than you do. This will help prevent any surprises down the line and make sure your project is completed on time and without incident. 

2) Have a plan - once you've got the basics down, it's important to create a plan for how you'll go about completing your project. This will help ensure that everything goes as planned and that nothing gets lost in the process. 

3) Be organized - when trying to complete a project by yourself, it can be helpful to have a list of supplies and items involved.

How do we create communities that work for everyone, regardless of age or background?
In an age where technology has opened up so many opportunities for people to connect and share ideas, it's important that communities remain accessible and inclusive. Ideas 2022 is a project that aims to create communities that work for everyone, regardless of background or age. By creating platforms that allow users to share their thoughts, experiences and ideas anonymously, we can help our younger members feel more connected and welcome in these often-competitive spaces. With this in mind, we're proposing the following: 1) Make it easier for people to find each other by providing a search bar on every community page. This way, anyone with an internet connection can join any discussion or start a new one without having to worry about who they're talking to. 2) Include more than just pictures and links on community pages. Use images, videos and articles to help make your site more engaging for users.
