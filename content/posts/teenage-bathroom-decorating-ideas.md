Conclusion
A good conclusion is the final ingredient in a creative work. It gives the audience a sense of closure and resolution, and can leave them feeling satisfied or even uplifted. A weak conclusion, on the other hand, can leave the audience feeling let down and dissatisfied.
To create a strong conclusion, start by thinking about what you want your audience to take away from your work. What are the main points you want to make? Once you know what you want to say, find a way to say it that is both memorable and impactful.

End with a bang, not a whimper. A powerful image, striking turn of phrase, or thought-provoking question can all make for a memorable conclusion. Whatever you do, don't simply repeat what came before or restate your thesis in a boring way.

How does creativity impact our lives: What impacts creativity in our day-to-day lives?
Creativity is an important part of our day-to-day lives. Whether it’s coming up with new ideas for a project or simply enjoying new perspectives, creativity impacts how we see the world and how we interact with others. Creative people are often seen as more innovative and resourceful than their less creative counterparts. In fact, according to a study by The Economist, the average creative person in the United Kingdom earns over £50,000 more than the average non-creative person. This implies that creativity does have a significant impact on our lives in ways that are beyond just creating new things.
