Types of innovation
There are many types of innovation, each with its own benefits and drawbacks. To get a better understanding of what types of innovation are available, it can be helpful to look at some examples. 
Innovation can come in the form of new products or services, new methods for doing something, or a change in how things are done. There are many different types of innovation available, so it is important to find what best suits your needs and business goals. 

Some benefits of innovation include improving customer service and satisfaction, creating new markets for products or services, expanding the reach of an existing product or service, and increasing productivity. However, there are also risks associated with any type of innovation. For example, if a company over-promises or under-delivers on their new product or service, this could harm their reputation and cause customers to abandon them.

The challenges of reaching our goals: How can we overcome roadblocks?
There are many challenges we face when looking to achieve our goals, but overcoming them is key to success. Here are a few examples:
First and foremost, it is important to have realistic expectations. If we set ourselves unrealistic goals, we will be less likely to achieve them. We should also be honest with ourselves about what we want and what our limitations are. This will help us identify any roadblocks that may stand in our way.

The second challenge is breaking the habit of procrastination. This can be difficult as it is an acquired taste, but having a regular plan and sticking to it will help us stay on track. However, if we don’t have enough motivation or if the situation feels too hard, it can be tough to keep going.

Thirdly, it is important to be consistent with our efforts.
