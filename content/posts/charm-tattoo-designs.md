What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but there are a few key things to remember when coming up with new creative ideas. First, it's important to consider what the idea is that you're trying to create. If you're just starting out, try to think of something that you've never done before or something that you would like to do more often. Next, make sure that your idea is interesting andinate enough to warrant further thought. Finally, be sure that you can actually execute your idea well-enough so that people will want to use it.
