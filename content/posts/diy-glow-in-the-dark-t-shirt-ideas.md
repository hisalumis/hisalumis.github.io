Types of creativity: What are they?
Creativity is a critical component of any creative organization. Whether it’s a small business, an artist, or a team of creatives, creativity is essential to making anything happen. There are many types of creativity, but three that are most important to businesses and artists alike are visual, auditory, and kinaesthetic. 
Visual creativity refers to the ability to see something and create ideas based on that. This can be done through drawing or painting, but often starts with seeing the idea in your head and then coming up with ways to turn it into a reality. Auditory creativity comes from creating sounds and melodies based on what you hear. This can be done through music creation or sound engineering, but often starts with imagining how the sound could be used in an application or project. Kinaesthetic creativity refers to the ability to touch something and create ideas based on that.

Why should someone take a big idea and turn it into a reality?
There are a few reasons why an idea can become something real. Maybe it's because it has the potential to solve a problem people have been dealing with for years, or maybe it's got the potential to change the way people live their lives. Whatever the reason, turning an idea into reality is something that can be difficult but definitely worth doing. Here are three tips on how to make your big idea a reality: 1) think long and hard about what you want your business to achieve, 2) do your research before starting your business, and 3) stay focused on what you want your business to be and not on what others are expecting it to be.

Home decorating ideas: From simple to intricate
Start with the basics: A home is a place of refuge, and comfort. You should make it your own by filling it with comfortable and stylish pieces that will help you relax and feel at home. Here are some simple but effective home decorating ideas to get you started:
1. Add a design element with an old piece of furniture. Search online or in stores for pieces that are already in good condition and were once used as part of a décor scheme. This can be either a chair or a dresser, as long as it is still in good condition and has not been updated in years. Place the piece near the entrance of your home so that people coming home see it first before getting too lost in all the other pieces on your walls.

2. Keep things fresh by using new products and trends from time to time.
