In some cases, innovation refers to new products or services that improve upon older ones while in other cases it might refer to a more fundamental change in how something is done. Regardless of what is meant by innovation, businesses must be constantly looking for ways to add value and solve problems if they hope to maintain a competitive edge.

What are big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are many dimensions to consider. These can be broken down into four categories: problem, solution, opportunity and impact. 
Problem: How can we make our world a better place? 
Solution: There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question; each person's perspective and situation will dictate the best way to solve a problem. However, there are a few general concepts that can be used in order to determine what type of solution may work best for a given situation. One such concept is called the "Golden Rule." This states that you should do what is right, even if it doesn't make sense at first. 

Opportunity: What are the possible consequences of our actions? 

Impact: What kind of change or impact will our solutions have?
