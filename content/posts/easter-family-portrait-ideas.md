What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to make something that you and others will enjoy. Whether it's a new idea for a product or service, or an innovative way of thinking about your work, creativity is essential to any business. Here are some creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Take a walk on the wild side: When it comes to creative ideas, there's nothing quite like spending time out on the open range. Find an abandoned quarry or animal pen for inspiration, and see what kind of new designs come into being as a result. 
2. Experiment with technology: Sometimes the most interesting things are the simplest things. Use technology to help you find new ways to express your ideas, and see what happens when you switch up your methods and channels.

What are the new ideas out there?
In the current political and social climate, there are a number of fresh ideas out there that could change the way we live and work. Here are 5 of them: 
1. A Universal Basic Income: This concept is gaining popularity due to the pressures of mass unemployment and inequality in society. It would provide income to everyone on a sliding scale, with no strings attached.
2. Autonomous Vehicles: This is an idea that has been gaining traction recently due to its potential for reducing traffic congestion and improving public transportation options.
3. Green Energy: The use of green energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power has seen a rise in popularity in recent years. This would allow us to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and help address climate change problems.

History of Invention: How did invention come about?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that had not been considered before. Invention has been around for centuries, and it began with the Greeks. In their manual The Iliad, Homer mentions the invention of the bow and arrow, which he says was created by Menelaus. Other ancient authors also mention the invention of new technologies. For example, Theophrastus wrote about a machine that could turn any object into wine, which he called the “Wine Maker”. The Chinese also invented various products such as silkworm cocoons and books in the 4th century BC.
