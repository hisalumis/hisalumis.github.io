How to start a blog?
If you're looking for ways to start a blog, here are some ideas to get you started. First, consider what kind of content you'd like to create. If you want to share thoughts on your work or politics, then your blog would be focused around that topic.

You don't want people trying to find your site by accident while they're browsing the internet; make sure your site is well-marked and easy to navigate.
