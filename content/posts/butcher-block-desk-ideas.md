This is because when people are brainstroming, they are thinking about one specific problem or idea and coming up with new ways to solve it.

In a world filled with so much noise and information, ideas can be a precious commodity. Without them, we would be lost in a sea of complacency or boredom.

Stop before you're too far: Sometimes it's better to stop when you're ahead of schedule.
One popular way to avoid becoming too far behind schedule is to take some time off from work and do things you enjoy. This can be done by either creating a plan or just taking a break. Other ideas for dealing with the feeling of being too far behind may include considering using a calendar app to keep track of when you will have other opportunities, setting goals for yourself that you can hit once you've caught up, or using a timer to keep track of how long it will take you to complete a task. When making decisions about when and how to take breaks, it's important to weigh the pros and cons according to what type of work we're doing.

Invention 3: a way to store food in the fridge without using plastic or airtight containers
According to scientists, there are three ways to store food in the fridge without using plastic or airtight containers. The first way is to use a fermentation process that breaks down the cellulose in plants into glucose and carbon dioxide. The second way is to use a vacuum sealer that sucks clean air out of the fridge and stores food in airtight containers. The third way is to use an oven as a warming oven that cooks food until it becomes safe to eat. all three methods have their own pros and cons.
