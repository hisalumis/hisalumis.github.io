The future of transportation: How will we get around in the future?
In the future, many people may want to drive themselves around instead of relying on public transportation. This is due to a variety of factors such as the rise in car ownership, the increasing number of trips people make, and the lucrative business opportunities that come with driving for oneself. 
Some ideas for how we will get around in the future include: 
-building more autonomous cars that can drive themselves; 
-establishing self-driving taxi services; 
-making it easier for people to buy cars that can drive themselves without having to take a driver's course or pay for a mechanic; 
- creatingDriverless Taxi Pilot Programs in various cities around the world; and 
-focusing on improving infrastructure so that it can support more vehicle traffic.

Ideas can be any thing that you want them to be, but they have to be ideas that you can think of. Usually, ideas come to you when you are in a hurry and don't have any time to think about them. Ideas can also come from your own thoughts or those of others. The best way to find out what ideas are around town is to take the initiative and start thinking about them yourself.
