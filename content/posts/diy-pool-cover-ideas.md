There are many ways to come up with new inventions, but the most important thing is to think of a solution that you can see happening in the future.

You can also look at industries that are in your field and see what products or services they currently use or would like to use in the future. Another way to come up with new inventions is by thinking outside the box. You can develop a product idea that isn't currently being used or marketed. This will give you an idea for how you could make your product stand out from the competition.
