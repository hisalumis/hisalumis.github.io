The different types of Invention: What are the different types of inventions?
Invention is a process of creating a new product or service from scratch. There are many different types of inventions, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Below are three examples of invention:
1) A new type of transportation: A car is an invention, because it has been around for centuries. 
2) A new type of food: We have invented grains and potatoes, so there is no one food that can be called "rice" or "potatoes." 
3) A new way to grow plants: We've invented peas and carrots, so there's no need for planting seeds in the ground all year round.

Examples: How can I use one of these ideas?
How to Use One of These Ideas: 
1. Start with a blank slate: Start by thinking about what you want your new project to be. What are some ideas for concepts or ideas you’d like to explore? Once you have a few ideas, start brainstorming them and see what comes up. 
2. Take your time: Don’t try to do everything at once. Instead, work on one part of the project at a time and then move on to the next. This will help you get started and avoid having too much work put on your plate at once. 
3. Be organized: Make sure that when you’re starting a project, you have an idea of what you need and how it will be organized. This way, when you get stuck, you know where to look for help.
