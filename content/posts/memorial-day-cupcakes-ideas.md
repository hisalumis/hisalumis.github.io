conclusion
Writing can be a difficult and daunting task, especially when it comes to coming up with creative ideas. However, there are some ways to make the process easier and more fun. Here are three tips to help you get those creative juices flowing:
1. Get organized: This may seem like a no-brainer, but getting your ideas down in a organized fashion will help you immensely when it comes time to start writing. Having everything sorted out ahead of time will allow you to focus on the actual writing, rather than trying to come up with what comes next.

2. Take breaks: Sometimes the best way to come up with fresh ideas is to take a break from writing altogether. Go for a walk, listen to music, or just step away from your work for a few minutes.

Contributions of invention: What has been done with invention that has changed the world?
Invention has had a profound impact on the world, from the creation of dishes that could be made without cookbooks to modern surgical tools and vehicles. Some inventions have even saved lives, such as the polio vaccine. In recent years, however, there has been a surge in innovation in the field of invention, with new ideas coming out all the time.

The definition of creativity
Creativity is an intangible quality that many people seek to define. However, any definition of creativity must have at least one key component - the inspiration and motivation to produce something new. In today's society, creativity is often praised for its ability to inspire change, but it can also be used to create things that are commercially successful. The definition of creativity will change over time as more and more evidence is brought to light that creative art has a number of benefits beyond simply making people happy.
