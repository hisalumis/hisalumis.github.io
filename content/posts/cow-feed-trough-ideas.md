Invention is the process of coming up with a new way to do something, or creating a new object or idea. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new product or service, or even a new way of life. There are so many different ways to come up with ideas, and there are always people who are willing to help out by submitting their suggestions and ideas to others. Some inventions become huge successes, while others are just shelved for future use.
