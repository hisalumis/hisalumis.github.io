The power of brainstorming: What are some good tips for brainstorming?
brainstorming is a great way to come up with new ideas. It can be used for anything from developing new products to finding a new business idea. Here are five tips for brainstorming: 1) Be specific about what you want to come up with. This will help you focus on the best ideas and avoid getting stuck in your routine. 2) Make sure you have a clear goal or target audience in mind before starting. This will help you find potential solutions that are relevant to your target market. 3) Work together with other people. This will give you the opportunity to exchange ideas and get feedback. 4) Avoid overthinking things. Just because something looks like it could be a good idea doesn’t mean it is! 5) Be patient and allow yourself time to think things through thoroughly.

Types of creativity:
Creativity is a broad term that can refer to any activity or feeling that leads to unique and original ideas. There are many different types of creativity, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Here are three examples: visual creativity, auditory creativity, and kinesthetic creativity.
Visual creativity is often measured by how much creative ideas the individual can come up with in a short amount of time. This type of creativity is often associated with art, fashion, and design. Visual artists may use various mediums such as paintings, sculptures, graphics, photography, and 3D printing to create their output.

coming up with new ways to do things: How can businesses come up with new ideas that work?
Businesses have been coming up with new ideas for years, but it can be hard to pinned down what works and what doesn't. Here are three tips to help you come up with new ideas: 
1. Try different methods of marketing: This might seem like a common-sense tip, but often times the best way to find a new customer is to try something different. Go beyond just traditional methods like advertising and social media promotion. 

2. Be open to change: When it comes time to come up with a new idea, don't be afraid to experiment. Sometimes the best way to find out if something is working is to give it a try and see what happens. 

3. Be persistent: It takes some effort – even stubbornness – to come up with new ideas that work.
