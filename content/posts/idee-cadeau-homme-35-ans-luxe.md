Definition of Innovation: How does innovation differ from other types of creativity?
Innovation is the process of creating something new and original, usually through the use of creativity. It is different from other types of creativity because it is not based on a preconceived idea or knowledge. Innovation can be seen as the ability to think outside the box and come up with ideas that no one else has thought of.

Conclusion: the benefits of creative art
Creative art is often thought of as a luxury, something that only the wealthy can afford to enjoy. However, the benefits of creative art are not just financial; they are also emotional and mental.
Creative art can help people to express themselves in ways that they may not be able to do with words. It can also be a way to release bottled-up emotions and feelings. For some people, creative art is a form of therapy that helps them to deal with difficult life events or traumas.

The benefits of creative art go beyond the individual. When people create art together, it can help to build bridges between cultures and communities. It can also be used as a tool for social change, raising awareness about important issues such as environmentalism or human rights.
