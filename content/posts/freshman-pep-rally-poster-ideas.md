The difference between brainstorming and coming up with solutions: Some key distinctions.
Some people might define brainstorming as coming up with ideas, while others might say that brainstorming is actually coming up with solutions to problems. In either case, the main difference between brainstorming and coming up with solutions lies in how the two activities are done.
In terms of how brainstorming is typically done, participants put together a list of ideas and then work on developing one or more possible solutions. This usually happens in small groups, which allows for each person to share their ideas and receive feedback.

Coming up with solutions, on the other hand, is typically a more solitary process. Participants typically work on tackle one or a few problems at a time and then come up with a plan to achieve their goals. Sometimes this occurs in group settings, but most times it’s best if someone alone comes up with the solution to a problem.

The Power of Idea: How do we get the most out of our ideas?
Ideas are the lifeblood of any business and creativity. From businesses to creativity, ideas can be the key to success. Here are five tips on how to get the most out of your ideas:
1. Define what you want your idea to achieve. Without a clear goal, it will be much harder to motivate yourself to work on it. define your idea in broad terms and break it down into smaller steps that you can complete easily. This will help you stay focused on the task at hand and avoid getting lost in the weeds.

2. Take a step back and ask yourself why you think this concept or product is necessary or valuable. Once you have a good reason for your idea, it becomes easier to focus on developing it further and writing marketability plans accordingly.

The power of imagination:
Creativity is a key aspect of any person’s life, and in some cases, it can be the spark that ignites an idea. For others, creativity may be something they are born with or something they learn how to use. Regardless of what creative ability someone has, there is always room for improvement. Here are four ways to use imagination to your advantage: 
1. As a tool for problem-solving. When you have an idea but no idea how to bring it to life, imagine doing it yourself. This can help you come up with solutions that seem impossible until you try them out.

2. As an inspiration for creativity. People have different styles and preferences when it comes to art, so by imagining what another artist might do or say, you can get ideas for your own work that would otherwise be hard to come by.
