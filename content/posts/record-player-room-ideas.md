what is an invention?
Invention is the process of creating something new, whether it’s a product, a process, or a service. It’s an important part of the business world, and it can be a lot of fun.
There are four main steps to inventing something: idea generation, development, prototyping, and commercialization. First, you have to come up with an idea for something new. This can be inspired by a problem you’ve noticed that needs solving, or by something you think would be cool or helpful to have. Once you have an idea, you need to develop it into a concept that can be turned into a physical product or service. This involves doing market research and feasibility studies to make sure your idea is viable and there’s demand for it.
