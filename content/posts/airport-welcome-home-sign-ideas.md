Invention: Limitations of invention
Invention limitations are a key concern for the modern age. Invention has played an important role in human society, and this is only expected to continue as technology advances. However, there are some areas where invention can be limited, which can have a significant impact on the economy and society. One such limitation is that innovation often begins with ideas and not with physical products or services. It is also important to note that new ideas often come from people who are not experts in their field and must work hard to develop them into a product or service that can be used by others.

The brainstroming phenomenon is a term used to describe a mental state in which a person has high levels of focus and concentration on one thing. Brainstroming can be described as being in a "zombie zone." This state can be caused by a variety of reasons such as stress, boredom, or fatigue. When the mind is focused on just one thing, it is difficult to move on from that focus.
