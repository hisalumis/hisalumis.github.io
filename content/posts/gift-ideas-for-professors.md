What are big ideas?
There are always big ideas out there, and it can be tough to come up with the perfect one. Here are four tips on how to come up with the best ideas: 
1. Brainstorm with others. Collaborating is key when coming up with big ideas. Talk to people who have experience in the area you want to explore and see what they think would make for an interesting solution. 
2. Avoid clichés. When coming up with big ideas, be mindful of clichés and other tired patterns that have been done before. Are there other ways to approach this problem that haven’t been considered? What new angles could you take into consideration? 
3. Be open to feedback. Don’t be afraid to ask your friends and family for their opinion on your ideas before you EVEN start thinking about putting them together!

Most people would say that ideas are what give life its purpose. However, for some, ideas are what keep them up at night. For example, one person might have an idea for a new product, but never have the time or the energy to make it a reality. Others might have an idea for a new project, but feel too shy or scared to go ahead with it. Whatever the case may be, ideas are what make us human and keep us on our toes.
