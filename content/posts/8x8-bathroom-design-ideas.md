1. Brainstorming is a process that helps us generate new ideas and solutions to problems.
2. It is a powerful tool that can be used to solve complex problems and come up with innovative solutions.
3. Brainstorming can be done alone or in groups, and it can be done online or offline.
4. Online brainstorming has many advantages over offline brainstorming, such as the ability to connect with people from all over the world, the ability to share ideas instantaneously, and the ability to get feedback quickly.
5. Offline brainstorming has its own advantages, such as the ability to focus more deeply on one's own thoughts, the opportunity to build relationships with team members, and the chance to brainstorm in person.
