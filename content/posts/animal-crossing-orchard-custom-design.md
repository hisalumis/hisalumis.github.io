What are the new ideas out there?
There are many new ideas out there, and it can be hard to determine which ones should be introduced into your project. Here are a few tips to help make the decision: 
-Start by asking yourself what you want your project to achieve. If you don’t know yet, consider including goals and target audience in your design.
-Once you have a good idea of what you want, look for potential solutions that could help achieve it. This means identifying problems that need to be solved before anything else can be done, and then thinking of ways to overcome them.
-Finally, consider how much money or time you’ll need to spend on developing the idea before making a decision. If it’s something you think will cost less than both of those things combined, go for it!
