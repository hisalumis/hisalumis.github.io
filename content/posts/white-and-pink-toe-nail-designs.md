Invention: How does innovation happen?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new way to do something. Sometimes, this comes about through the sharing of ideas or the discovery of a new resource. Sometimes, it comes about through the development of a new product or service.
In any case, innovation happens in many ways and at different speeds. Here are four examples that illustrate how: 

1) Invention often happens spontaneously - people will often come up with ideas for new products or services while they are still working on other projects. 
2) Invention can be slow - sometimes it takes years for someone to develop a new product or service that is really useful. 
3) Invention can be fast - sometimes people can come up with ideas for products and services in minutes or even seconds.
