What is the future of technology?
There is no one answer to the question of what the future of technology holds. However, some potential ideas include: 

1. Virtual reality becoming more mainstream- This could involve using headsets to experience virtual worlds that are not actually there. This could help people learn new things and escape stress. 
2. Artificial intelligence becoming more advanced- This could involve creating machines that can think for themselves, and eventually end up taking over many tasks in our lives. 
3. New technologies being developed- Some of these include: quantum computing, 3D printing, and autonomous cars. These are just a few examples, and there are plenty of other possibilities that could be explored in the future.

2020: The year of the moon
Given that the moon is a natural satellite of Earth, it has been speculated for many years what could happen if human beings were to explore and land on the moon. And while 2020 is not necessarily the year that such a mission would be attempted, there are plenty of ideas out there for when such an endeavor could take place. Here are four examples: 
The first idea involves space travel to the moon by using a small spacecraft called Artemis. This spacecraft would be able to dock with a Russian Luna-15 spacecraft and release its astronauts in order to study the moon's surface. 
Another idea involves exploring space stations on the moon. These stations would provide research resources and rotating crews that could also conduct tasks like mining or robotic excavation. 
Lastly, we have another idea involving sending humans back down to the moon in an effort to change certain aspects of its environment.

Prototyping: What is prototyping and when should you do it?
Prototyping is a process of designing and creating prototypes of products or services in order to gain feedback and improve the design.
