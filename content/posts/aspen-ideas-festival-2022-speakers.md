The Power of Ideas: What does it mean when you have great ideas?
When it comes to ideas, there is no one answer that is perfect. Great ideas come from all over, and can vary in terms of what they entail. However, the key to success with any idea is to have a clear vision for it and then make sure that the idea can be executed effectively. This means taking into consideration both the financial and logistical feasibility of bringing the idea to reality. Once those hurdles are overcome, great ideas often result in successful products or businesses.
