What is innovation?
Innovation is the act of coming up with a new and original idea or approach to something. It can be anything from a new product or service to an innovative way of running a business. There are many types of innovation, but some are more popular than others. Here are four examples:
1. Creative invention – This type of innovation comes from coming up with an original solution to a problem that someone else had before you. This can be something as simple as creating a new type of bread recipe or developing a way to cut costs in your business.

2. Collective intelligence – This is when two or more people come up with an idea for solving a common problem and then work together to make it happen. This can be something as simple as coming up with a better way to stock shelves or finding new ways to sell products.
