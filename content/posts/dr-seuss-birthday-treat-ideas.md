What is Invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or design. Innovation is key to businesses and societies, both here in the United States and around the world. And while it can come from any form of creativity-from simple change to groundbreaking technology-invention has a special history and meaning in America.
It was on July 14, 1776, when Continental Congress passed the Declaration of Independence, which declared that each state was an independent nation with its own rights and destiny. Inventions dating back to ancient Greece and Rome had helped make these ideas a reality. But what made America unique? The answer lies in its history of innovation, not just as a country but also as a place where people from all walks of life could come together to share their ideas and dreams.

Innovation is at the heart of American identity.

The power of creativity: How can it help you succeed?
Creativity is a powerful tool that can help you succeed in any field. By using creativity, you can come up with new ideas and strategies that can help you achieve your goals. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when using creativity as a tool: first, be realistic about what you want to achieve. Don't expect to create something overnight or from scratch; rather, use creativity as an engine to help you realize your goals. Additionally, be sure that your creative ideas are feasible and achievable. If they aren't, you may find it difficult to implement them into reality. Finally, don't forget the importance of practice! The more time you spend practicing your creative processes, the better equipped you will be for anything that comes your way – whether it's creating new ideas or finishing projects.
