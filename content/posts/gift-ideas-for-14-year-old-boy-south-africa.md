creating: How do you create ideas?
Creative ideas are a key part of any successful business. By understanding how to create and use creative ideas, you can improve your chances of success. Here are some tips to help you get started:
1. Come up with a specific idea. One of the most important things to do when creating creative ideas is to come up with a specific goal that you want to achieve. This will help you focus on what needs to be done instead of thinking about every possible option.

2. Look for inspiration. When looking for inspiration, don’t just look at things that have already been done or that have been popular in the past. Check out those that have gone above and beyond in order to get an idea of what you could do yourself (and make sure you avoid copying anyone!).

3. Be flexible.

Brainstroming is the act of thinking about thoughts that are not actually relevant to the current topic at hand. This can be done in any way that feels comfortable to the individual, but often involvesandering off into tangents or making up ideas on the spot. It can be an effective way to clear out your head and come up with new ideas, but it is also a cause for concern as it can lead towidgetwasting or lost time.
