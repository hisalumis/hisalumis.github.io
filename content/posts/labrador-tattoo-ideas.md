What are the new ideas?
The new ideas in health care are based on the concept of patient-centricity, which is the idea that patients should always be the focus of the healthcare system. This shift away from traditional hospital-based care to apatient-led model would result in a reduction in costs and better patient outcomes. Another proposal is to adopt more outpatient services, such as walk-ins and telehealth. Other new ideas include using AI to help doctors rule out potential treatments and using data analytics to diagnose and treat diseases.
