The different ways in which creativity can be used in art: To create atmosphere, mood, or story
There are numerous ways in which creativity can be used in art, from creating atmosphere to mood to story. Here are four examples:
1. Atmosphere: by adding a sense of calm or excitement, an artist can create a believable and distracting environment for the viewer to inhabit.
2. Mood: by using different colors and brushstrokes, an artist can create a range of emotions that can be manipulated through composition and color alone.
3. Storytelling: by weaving together disparate elements into one story or plot, an artist can create engaging and dimensional work that becomes both memorable and unforgettable.

What to include in your blog:
Blogging can be a fun and rewarding way to share your thoughts, experiences, and ideas with the world. However, not all bloggers have everything they need in their blog to make it successful. Some bloggers may lack important pieces of equipment or content that can damage their blog's popularity and cause them to lose traffic and followers. Here are some tips on what to include in your blog so that you can achieve great success:
1. Make Your Blog Name glaringly obvious: The first thing most people will notice when they visit your blog is the name. This should be the first thing you focus on making sure is correctly spelled and easily remembered. If you cannot remember your blog's name, it will likely suffer from low popularity and fewer visitors.

How do you come up with new ideas?
As a creative thinker, you face many challenges when coming up with new ideas. One challenge is that it can be difficult to remember just what worked the last time you came up with an idea. Additionally, it can be difficult to come up with novel approaches to problem solving.  So how do you come up with new ideas? 
One approach is to brainstorm. By brainstorming, you can get rid of any old ideas and start from scratch. Additionally, by using headphones or other distractions, you can create an environment in which you are unable to think of any other ideas. Finally, if you have a specific idea in mind but are not sure how to bring it to life, then you can try outframing or milking an existing idea for new potential insights.
