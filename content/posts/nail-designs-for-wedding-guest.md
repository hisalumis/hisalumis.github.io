Brainstroming is a mental process that helps to focus and organize thoughts. It can be used in both personal and professional settings. The process starts with identifying the main thoughts in your mind and then sorting them into piles or groups. From there, you can start to work on one or more specific tasks based on what you’ve assigned to those thoughts.

Players use their brain to guess the order of cards in a deck, and then put them back in the deck so that the next card is at the bottom. The game is scoreless, but players can win by guessing the order of cards in an opponent's deck and putting them back in place so that their own card is at the top.

The New Workplace: What are the new trends in work?
The new workplace is a place where employees can be their best selves. There are many different ideas for the new workplace, but some of the most popular ones include:
1. In-person meetings: Company executives and managers now often hold face-to-face meetings to discuss important business issues. This allows employees to have a more direct conversation with their superiors.

2. Virtual work environments: Employees can now work from home or from any location in the world. This allows companies to save on office space and time.

3. Online applications: Companies are increasingly using online applications to connect with potential employees. This makes it easier for companies to find qualified workers and eliminates the need for physical interviews.
