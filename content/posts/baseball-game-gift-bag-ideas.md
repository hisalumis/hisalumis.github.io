Innovation: How can you use innovation to create new products or services?
Innovation is the process of coming up with new ways to do something. It can be used to create new products or services, but it can also be used to improve existing ones. There are a number of ways to use innovation to create new products or services, and each one has its own set of benefits and drawbacks. Here are some tips on how you can use innovation to create new products or services: 
1. Try out different ideas and prototypes before launch. This will help you measure whether your product or service is working as expected and find any potential issues early on. 
2. Be open to feedback and change. When trying out different ideas, be open to what other people have to say about them. This will help you develop a better understanding of your product or service and the user experience.
