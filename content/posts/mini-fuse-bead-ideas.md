Creativity and art: What are the benefits?
Creativity and art are two of the most important aspects of life. Whether it is working on a painting or writing a story, creativity is needed to create something new. However, there are some disadvantages to having great creativity. First, often times creativity can be difficult to control. Second, with great creativity comes a lot of risk. For example, if you don't have a good eye for color or if you make mistakes while painting, your work might not look as good as it could. But overall, the benefits of creativity far outweigh any negatives. So whether you're looking for an outlet to express yourself or just want to have fun, creative art is worth exploring!

The creative process: How does the creative process work?
Creative ideas come to life when artists and writers share their thoughts, feelings and experiences with one another. The creative process begins with inspiration, which is the first step in developing a creative idea. Next, the artist or writer must come up with a unique concept that will capture the attention of others. Once the idea has been captured, it’s time for the writer or artist to flesh out the idea into a full-blown story or novel. Finally, unless there’s an incredible lucky streak, every book or story has to be well-researched and Fallon writes about creating new ideas on a daily basis - whether that’s coming up with an original character or imagining what might happen if she were ever given the opportunity to work on a project her own choosing.
