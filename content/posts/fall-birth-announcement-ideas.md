creativity: How do you improve your invention ideas?
Creativity is essential to any invention. Every step of the process from Ideation to Execution should be tailored to increase creativity and improve the chances of a successful product. Here are four tips for improving your invention ideas:
1. Be persistent
Inevitably, every invention will not be perfect. That’s okay! The important thing is that you keep trying and learning until you find something that works well and can be improved upon. Keep a notebook or digital sketchbook where you can jot down ideas as they come to you, so you have access to them when needed. This way, you won’t get lost in your work and can focus on what really matters- developing a great product.

2. Be open to feedback
Feedback is key in ANY creative process.

What are some invention ideas?
There are many invention ideas out there, and it can be hard to know which ones to pursue. Here are a few tips to help you make the best choices:
1. Look at what others have done before you. If you're looking for an idea that's already been done, take a look at existing patents, copyrights, or other sources of inspiration.

2. Consider your target market. What is your target market? Are you looking for a specific audience or market? This will help you determine which invention ideas might be most successful for you.

3. Try multiple methods of experimentation. You don't have to duplicate everything that someone else has done before you; instead, try different methods of experimentation and see which ones work best for you.

4. Get feedback from people who know your target market well.

Definition of Invention: inventions are the results of creative thinking.
Invention is the result of creative thinking. This thinking can be done in a number of ways, but the most common way to come up with new ideas is through brainstorming. brainstorming is an informal process where people share their ideas with one another, without any specific goal in mind. By doing this, you can come up with a number of new ideas that could potentially be used in a product or service.
What makes brainstorming so helpful is that it allows for creativity to freely flow. When people areallowed to go at their own pace and have unrestricted access to their thoughts, they are more likely to come up with new and innovative solutions. This quality helps inventions become more effective and innovation becomes more commonplace.
