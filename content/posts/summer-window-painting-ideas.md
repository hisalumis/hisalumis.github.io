Invention is the process of coming up with a new way to do something, or creating a new object or idea. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new product or service, or even a new way of life. There are so many different ways to come up with ideas, and there are always people who are willing to help out by submitting their suggestions and ideas to others. Some inventions become huge successes, while others are just shelved for future use.

Cultural aspects of Invention: How do people React to Innovation?
When someone comes up with a new invention, people often react in different ways. Some people may be excited by the idea, while others may be skeptical. Still others may just be curious. Different reactions mean that different people have different perspectives on innovation. 
One example of how people react to innovation is through patenting. Patenting an invention means that somebody has made something that is exclusive to them and can't be copied or used by anyone else. This can help protect the inventor's work from being copied or used without permission. 

Another example of how people react to innovation is through creativity. When somebody comes up with a new idea, they may be inspired by it or they might not be. It all depends on the person and their perspective on innovation.
