What are big ideas?
Big Ideas are ideas that are so large, they can't be crammed into a small amount of time. They can take up a lot of thought and effort, but they have the potential to change the world. Here are some examples of big ideas:
1. A universal basic income. This is an idea that has been around for years, but it is still not widely accepted. It would be money that is given to everyone regardless of their income, so it would not depend on fertility rates or any other factors.

2. Education reform. Education is one of the most important aspects of our society and economy, and it needs to be improved in order to make sure everyone can get the education they need.

Conclusion: Ideas are the lifeblood of progress
Ideas are the lifeblood of progress. Without them, we would be stuck in the same place, doing the same things, day in and day out. Ideas help us to see things in new ways, to find new solutions to old problems, and to keep moving forward.
There are a few key things to keep in mind when coming up with ideas:

1. Be open-minded. Be willing to consider all possibilities, no matter how far-fetched they may seem at first.

2. Take inspiration from others. Look at what others have done and see how you can build on their ideas or take them in a new direction.

3. Don’t be afraid to experiment. Try out different approaches and see what works best for you.

How do we make sure that our technology helps us achieve our goals rather than hinder them?
Technology has a lot to offer in helping us achieve our goals, but it should be used responsibly. There are a number of ways technology can help us achieve our goals, but some are more harmful than others. Here are three examples: 
1. Technology can help us automate tasks and reduce the amount of time we have to spend on them. This can lead to decreased productivity and increased workloads. 
2. Technology can help us communicate with other people and devices more easily. This can lead to less communication and collaboration between team members. 
3. Technology can help us track our progress and organize our work more effectively. This can lead to better management of resources and improved productivity overall.
