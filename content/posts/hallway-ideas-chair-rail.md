The three types of big ideas: A crazy idea, a good idea, and a bad idea
There are three types of big ideas: crazy, good, and bad. Crazy ideas are always exciting, and can help to change the course of history. Good ideas have the potential to make a big impact on people and the world. However, there is always risk associated with them- some might be great, while others might not be so great after all. But when it comes time to make a decision, it’s important to weigh the risks and benefits of each idea before coming up with a decision.
Bad Ideas are simply terrible, and often have no chance of becoming anything other than infamous failures. They may seem like something that could never work or might even lead to disaster- but in reality, they often do just that. It’s important to be vigilant when assessing any new idea- especially those with such potential for disaster.

Definition of innovation: A new way of doing things
Innovation is the alteration of the way something is done, or the creation of a new product or service. Innovation can be seen as a way to improve efficiency, lower costs, create new products and services, or to solve problems that have been unsolved. Over time, innovation has become an essential part of technological progress and has led to advances in a variety of industries.
There are several definitions of innovation that are used by different groups and individuals. One definition is "the process by which new ideas, products or services are created." This definition includes both the idea that innovation takes place in addition to existing technologies, as well as the idea that it is not limited to any one sector but can encompass a wide range of industries. Another definition is "a sudden change in state from one having existed for some time before" which could refer to changes in business models or technology.

The challenge of creativity: How do we overcome obstacles and reach our creative destination?
Creativity is an essential part of any person's life. It can be used to create things that no one has thought of before or to come up with new ideas for products or services. However, there are often obstacles that stand in the way of reaching our creative destination. Some of the most common obstacles include lack of experience, creativity being blocked by fear, and a lack of support from those around us. How can we overcome these challenges and reach our creative destination? There are a few ways to start with, but each person's journey will be unique. One approach is to find a group of people who share your same interests and/or goals, and ask them to help you brainstorm ideas. Another way is to read books on creativity or watch videos on the subject. Finally, you can visit art museums and galleries if you're interested in seeing creative works in person.
