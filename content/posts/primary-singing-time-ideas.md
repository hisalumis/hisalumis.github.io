What is creativity?
Creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, concepts, or solutions to problems. It can be found in everything from fashion design to science fiction writing. In spite of its many forms, creativity is often thought of as a single-minded pursuit. But that's not always accurate. Creative art can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of their skill level or creativity levels.

Thesis: What are some new ideas that could help improve our lives?
There are many new ideas that could help improve our lives, but one idea that has been gaining a lot of attention is the so-called “smart home”. This is a concept where consumers can access various services and devices in their homes through a network of connected devices. Smart home technologies have the potential to improve our lives by allowing us to control our environments more effectively, save time and money, and reduce stress. Here are four examples of how smart home technologies could help improve our lives.
1. Automatic noise cancellation: Automated noise cancellation technology can help reduce background noise during activities such as sleep or work. By Knowing when and where the sound is coming from, we can adjust the level of sound insulation or sound reinforcement in order to create an environment that is both comfortable and quiet.

Definition of innovation: What is it, and how does it differ from other types of innovation?
Innovation is the process of creating new and unique products or services that solve a problem. It can be defined in many ways, but one common definition is that innovation is the creation of a new way of doing something. Innovation can come from anywhere in the company, including the idea behind the product or service, as well as from within team members themselves. In order to be effective, innovation must be mutual and collaborative; it should not just rely on one person’s ideas or insights. 
One key difference between innovation and other forms of innovation is its focus on solving problems. Other types of innovation often seek to create new products or services that appeal to consumers (instead of solving problems), which can lead to less innovation overall. Innovation is instead focused on helping companies achieve their goals by improving their products or services.

Most people have them. Some people act on them. A few people change the world with them. Ideas are a dime a dozen, but a good one is hard to come by. This is why society often looks to the few who seem to have an endless supply of originality: artists, inventors, entrepreneurs.
