How do we create communities that work for everyone, regardless of age or background?
In an age where technology has opened up so many opportunities for people to connect and share ideas, it's important that communities remain accessible and inclusive. Ideas 2022 is a project that aims to create communities that work for everyone, regardless of background or age. By creating platforms that allow users to share their thoughts, experiences and ideas anonymously, we can help our younger members feel more connected and welcome in these often-competitive spaces. With this in mind, we're proposing the following: 1) Make it easier for people to find each other by providing a search bar on every community page. This way, anyone with an internet connection can join any discussion or start a new one without having to worry about who they're talking to. 2) Include more than just pictures and links on community pages. Use images, videos and articles to help make your site more engaging for users.

The challenges of innovation: What are they and how can they be overcome?
Innovation is a challenge that can be overcome through creativity, risk-taking, and determination. In order to thrive in the digital age, businesses must embrace innovation as methodology and not just a one-time event. To ensure success, companies must have a clear understanding of what they are trying to accomplish with their innovation and how they plan on achieving it. Additionally, companies must be willing to experiment and take risks when it comes to their products and services in order to stay ahead of the competition.

Invention, as any creative act, is the result of a collaboration of many people. From the inventor who conceived of the idea to the engineer who designed and built the product, every step in the process is essential to its success. Inventors must be able to see their ideas from start to finish, and must be able to articulate their concepts so that others can understand them.
