What is brainstroming and how does it work?
There is a lot of debate surrounding the term brainstroming. What is it? And how does it work? The answer to both questions is that brainstroming occurs when people are unfocused or processor-locked. This can lead to a lack of focus and an inability to process information. It’s often difficult to know where to turn or what to do next, which can result in a feeling of emptiness or hopelessness.
Brainstroming is typically accompanied by feelings of helplessness and confusion. People may feel like they don’t have any control over their lives and they don’t know what to do next. This can be a difficult time for both the person with brainstroming and those around them. It’s important for those with brainstroming to seek help if they feel lost or hopeless.

Business models: How do inventors develop their ideas?
Invention ideas are not always easy to come by, but they can be very valuable. They can help businesses of all sizes create new products or services that might not have been possible before. If you're thinking of coming up with an invention, it's important to think about how you would go about doing it. There are many different business models that inventors can develop their ideas in, and each one has its own unique advantages and disadvantages.
One popular business model for inventor development is the Prototyping Method. This approach involves creating a model of a product or service that will allow for feedback and modification until it is ready to be released to the public. This allows inventors to test their ideas before they even release them to the public, which can help them immensely in terms of refining their concepts and getting more feedback from potential customers.
