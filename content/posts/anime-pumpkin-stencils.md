History of innovation: How has it been used and abused in the past?
The history of innovation is filled with examples of it being used and abused. In the past, innovation has been used to improve efficiency, increase production, decrease costs, and create new products. However, these same advantages can also be abused if not Properly managed.

Innovation can be abused when it is used for unoriginal or unwanted purposes. For example, in the early 1900srialist countries like Russia used innovation to produce innovative Catherine the Great cars while developing other technologies behind the scenes which led to their rise to power. By doing this, they were able to stay afloat during a time where other countries were struggling. However, this practice resulted in Russian technology becoming outdated and eventually lost its competitive edge. 

Similarly, in China during the late 1990s there was a large focus on artificial intelligence (AI) as part of efforts to modernize their economy.

Historical overview: How has the definition of invention changed over time?
Invention has undergone many changes throughout history. Over time, the definition of what qualifies as an invention has varied, in large part due to the development of new technologies. Today, invention typically refers to any innovation that is not simply a modification or improvement on something that has been done before. This includes developments in fields such as engineering and technology, but also includes ideas and concepts that may never have been put into practice.
One of the most significant changes to the definition of invention occurred in the early 1800s, when advances in technology led to a proliferation of new ideas for products and services that could be called inventions. Prior to this period, most innovations were seen as improvements on existing concepts or methods. This changed with the introduction of steam power and other technologies that allowed for more complex machines and processes.
