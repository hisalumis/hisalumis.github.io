What’s in store for the future of technology?
This year, many articles and presentations were made about the future of technology. The topics ranged from the digital age to artificial intelligence and beyond. However, one thing that was conspicuously absent was any discussion on how technology could impact our social lives. 
It seems that many people are still quite unsure of how technology will have an impact on our daily lives. Some believe that it will only be a force for good, while others remain worried about its ability to divide us further along lines of gender, race, and economic status. Some may even see it as a harbinger of great evil - like in the case of AI becoming self-aware and exploiting humans for their own gain. But whatever the future holds, one thing is for sure: tech will have an important role to play.

The challenges of innovation and its impact on business.
Innovation is one of the most important aspects of business. It allows firms to create new products and services that can be sold and generate new revenue. However, innovation can be challenging and has a strong impact on businesses. There are several challenges that companies face when trying to adopt innovative practices: 1) Lack of understanding of how innovation works – Many businesses are not sure what it takes to implement an innovation strategy and how it affects their business. 2) Implementation failures – When taking steps to adopt innovative practices, many firms end up implementing them incorrectly or without enough detail. This can lead to failed efforts, wasted resources and expensive lawsuits. 3) The negative effect of innovations – Some innovations have a significant positive impact on businesses such as increased efficiency or lowered costs. However, some innovations have a harmful impact, such as creating dependence on foreign manufacturers or exacerbating social disparities.
