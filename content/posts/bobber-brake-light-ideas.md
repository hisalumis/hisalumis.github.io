Prototype and Evaluation: How does one go about creating a prototype of an invention?
Prototype is a term that is often used in the industry to describe a preliminary version of an invention. It can also be used more generally to describe any form of product or service development. Prototype development typically begins with the identification of an idea or problem that needs to be solved before starting on the full development process. Once the problem has been identified, it is possible to explore potential solutions and prototypes can be created based on these solutions. After prototypes have been created, it is important to evaluate them for their feasibility and how they might be improved.
