New products are being created all the time that could be appealing to people, such as new transportation options, wellness advancements, and more. It is hard to come up with a specific idea for a new product, but here are some possibilities: 1. A bike-sharing service that would allow people to use bikes to get around town instead of having to take public transportation. This could be especially helpful for those who live in complexes or have difficult access to public transportation. 2.
