Ideas: What are they?
Everyone has their own ideas, whether they are creative or not. Ideas can be anything from a new recipe to a way to solve a problem. They can also be justifications for what someone has done in the past, or ways to make something better. 
Ideas can be incredibly helpful when it comes to creating things or solving problems. However, they can also backfire if not properly considered. For example, if an idea is something that an individual has never done before, but is based on their own personal experience or insights, it may be more likely to succeed than if it is something that was originated by someone else. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that ideas should not be taken too seriously; rather, they should be used as a tool for exploring and growth rather than as the only source of information.

Creative Process: How do we begin to come up with ideas?
Creative process is the process of coming up with ideas. The creative process can be broken down into 5 steps: 1. Brainstorming: This step is where you come up with ideas based on what you’ve heard or seen. It can be helpful to take some time to think about the idea and its potential implications. 2. Crafting: This step is where you come up with a specific plan for how to make your idea a reality. You might need to consider how your idea will impact other people, businesses, or even yourself. 3. Implementation: Once you’ve created a plan and crafted an idea, it’s time for the implementation phase! This includes figuring out how to make your idea a reality and getting your team on board.
