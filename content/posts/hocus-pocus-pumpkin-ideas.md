Types of big ideas:
There are many types of big ideas, but six are particularly important. These are called "big ideas for the future." They can help people develop a plan to improve things they care about in the present and create new opportunities for the future.
1. A universal health care system: This is a big idea that may seem complicated or impractical, but if it works it would be a huge step forward in improving our economy and reducing social unrest.
