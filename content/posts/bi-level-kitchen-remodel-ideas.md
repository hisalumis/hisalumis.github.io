How to Get organized: This is one of the most important aspects of being organized, and there are plenty of ways to do it. Make sure you choose the method that is best for you.
One of the most important decisions you make when it comes to becoming organized is what kind of organization you want. There are a number of different types of organizational systems that can work for different people, but here are two examples: The Zen Method and the 7 Laws of Order.
The Zen Method is a way to live in the moment and not think about how things should be done. It is based on the idea that everything happening in life at any given time is optional and can be changed at any time by simply changing your mind. This system does not require any prior planning or organizing knowledge, which makes it ideal for those who are new to being organized.

The 7 Laws of Order are similar to theZen Method, but they focus on living in the present moment and using simple rules to govern everything.
