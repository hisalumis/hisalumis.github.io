How can creativity be used in your business?
Creativity is a necessary part of any business. It can be used to come up with new ideas, to develop marketing strategies, or to come up with new products or services. However, creativity can also be used in bad ways. For example, some companies use creativity as an excuse not to take risks or make changes. Others use creative ideas as a way to avoid paying their bills or meeting deadlines. Ultimately, creativity is important in any business, but it can be abused if used improperly.
