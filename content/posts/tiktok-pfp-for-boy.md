Invention ideas can be found all over the internet. Sometimes they are simple, like a new product, or more complex, like a new way of doing something. Sometimes the idea is simple enough to be implemented, but it can take longer than expected to come up with a good plan for how to actually make it a reality.

Types of creativity: Realistic, abstract, etc.
Creativity is a difficult thing to define. Some people might say that creativity is ideas that come out of the blue, while others might say that creativity is being able to come up with new and exciting ways to do something. To some, it may be easy to see how creativity can be used in art, while others might not have a specific definition for what creative art really is. However, regardless of what someone believes or how they define it, there are definitely types of creativity that are more realistic than abstract and more realistic than creative art.

Brainstroming is a term that refers to the act of brainstorming, a type of thinking process where ideas are generated quickly and without any pre-determined order. Brainstroming can be helpful in finding new ideas or solutions to problems, and it can also be a great way to get feedback from others about your thoughts. Some people find Brainstroming to be relaxing and calming, while others find it difficult to focus on anything for very long.

Overcoming roadblocks: how to keep the ideas flowing
Brainstorming is a great way to overcome roadblocks and keep the ideas flowing. However, it can be difficult to come up with new ideas if you feel like you've hit a wall. Here are a few tips to help you get the most out of your brainstorming sessions:
1. Set some ground rules. Before you start brainstorming, agree on a few ground rules with your team. For example, you might want to agree that everyone will have a turn to share their ideas, and that no one will judge or criticize any ideas.

2. Get creative with prompts. If you're struggling to come up with new ideas, try using prompts to jump-start your creativity. You can either use prompts that are related to the task at hand, or completely unrelated topics that will get your brain thinking in new ways.
