How creativity is used in the creative process: creative drawings, paintings, poems, etc.
Creativity is a key component of the creative process. By using different creative methods, artists are able to come up with new ideas and solutions that can help them achieve their goals. For example, when creating a painting, a creative artist might use different colors to create a realistic scene. Similarly, when writing poetry, the writer may use alliteration or other forms of poetry to make the words seem more interesting. In both cases, the artist and writer are trying to find ways to express themselves through their art.
