Benefits of creativity: What do you gain from being creative?
Creativity can be defined as the ability to come up with new ideas, ideas that are different from what is currently accepted and/or common, or anything that is original.

There are many benefits to being creative, some of which include: increased productivity due to the increased variety of ideas, improved communication and problem-solving skills because of how you can come up with new solutions quickly, and even better grades in school because creativity often leads to new ways of thinking that may be unorthodox but are still effective.
