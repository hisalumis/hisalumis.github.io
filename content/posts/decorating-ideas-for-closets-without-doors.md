The different types of creative art
There are many different types of creative art. The most common are painting, sculpture, photography, and architecture. However, there are many other forms of creative art, such as pottery, jewelry making, and quilting.
Each type of creative art has its own unique characteristics. For example, painting is a two-dimensional form of art that uses color to create images on a canvas. Sculpture is a three-dimensional form of art that uses various materials to create statues or other objects. Photography is a two-dimensional form of art that captures images using a camera. Architecture is the art and science of designing and constructing buildings.

Different types of creative art appeal to different people. Some people enjoy the challenge of creating something from nothing, while others prefer the satisfaction of taking an existing object and making it their own.

What is innovation and how does it differ from other types of creativity?
Innovation is a process of creating new ideas or products that solve a problem. It can come in many forms- from the invention of the telephone to the development of new drugs. 
One important difference between innovation and creativity is that innovation typically involves more than one person. In order to create something new, you need to come up with a solution that meets the needs of your audience and is unique to them. On the other hand, creativity often comes from within- people working on their own projects without any outside help. This type of creativity often produces more original ideas and products than those developed in collaboration.
