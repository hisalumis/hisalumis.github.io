What is innovation and how does it differ from other forms of creativity?
Innovation is a term that has been used for different things in different times. It can be considered to be two different concepts, although they have many similarities. Innovation can be defined as the process of coming up with a new solution to a problem. This solution can be something that was previously thought impossible or something that was not even considered possible before. Innovation is also often described as being different from other forms of creativity, which is what this article will focus on. Other forms of creativity may involve coming up with ideas or solutions that are not practical or feasible.
