Benefits of creativity: What do you gain from being creative?
Creativity can be defined as the ability to come up with new ideas, ideas that are different from what is currently accepted and/or common, or anything that is original. Creative individuals often have a better imagination and are more creative than those who do not. There are many benefits to being creative, some of which include: increased productivity due to the increased variety of ideas, improved communication and problem-solving skills because of how you can come up with new solutions quickly, and even better grades in school because creativity often leads to new ways of thinking that may be unorthodox but are still effective.

How do you make your blog stand out from the rest?
There are a few things you can do to make your blog stand out from the rest. Here are some ideas: 
1. Use a unique tagline. This will help people know where they can find your blog, and it will also help you attract more traffic.

2. Make your blog content interesting and helpful. People want to read helpful, informative posts, not just those that are empty calories or boring information dumps.

3. Be funny and entertaining. Blogging is a fun hobby, so make sure your content is both enjoyable and informative too!

4. Be original. When other bloggers start using the same template or style for their blogs, it becomes difficult for them to stand out from the crowd. So be unique and think outside the box!
