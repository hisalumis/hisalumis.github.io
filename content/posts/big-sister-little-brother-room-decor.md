Innovation Processes: How do inventors produce new inventions?
Invention processes vary depending on the type of invention. For example, a new food product may be developed through a research process that involves tasting and analyzing different foods to find the best ones to make. In other cases, an inventor may simply come up with an idea and then work on developing it until it becomes a reality. However, no matter what the process, innovation always starts with an inventor’s idea.
