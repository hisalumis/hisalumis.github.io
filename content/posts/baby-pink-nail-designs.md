Innovation: How can new ideas be brought to market and be successful?
New ideas are one of the most important things that a company can bring to market. Successful companies have been able to develop new ideas that go beyond the standard and bring in new customers and profits. Here are some tips on how to bring your new idea to market:
1. Be prepared for rejection
One of the biggest challenges for any new idea is being rejected by those who have been familiar with your product or service before. This might be due to a lack of innovation, or it could be because your product is not yet available in an affordable price point. Regardless, make sure you are prepared to face rejection and continue working on your idea until it becomes a reality.

2. Be persistent
It takes a lot of hard work and perseverance to bring your idea to market. However, if you keep at it, you will eventually reach your goals.

1. Make a list of key ideas 
This is probably the most important step in brainstorming, as it will help you determine which ones you should keep in mind for further consideration. Once you have a few key ideas, it's time to begin working on developing them into full-blown concepts. 
2. Take some time for yourself
