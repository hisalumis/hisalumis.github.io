Idea 3: A new type of battery
An inventor has come up with a new type of battery that could be used in many different applications. This battery, called an energy storage battery, could help people save power and money by storing energy rather than using it when it's needed.

The Three Types of Ideas: What are they and how should you use them?
Ideas are a type of ammunition that can be used to improve a person's productivity, creativity and overall outlook. There are three main types of ideas: operational, problem-solving and innovative.
Operational ideas involve tasks that can be completed quickly and easily. These include things like fixing a car or getting the cat out of the dog's toy box. Problem-solving ideas involve taking several steps in order to find a solution to a problem. These include solving an equation for example, or figuring out how to make something work better. Inventive ideas involve coming up with new ways to do something, or finding an old way of doing something and adapting it to new circumstances.

Conclusion
Creative Art: The End of an Era?
For years, creative art has been a staple in society. Whether it’s paintings in a museum or music playing on the radio, art is everywhere. However, with the rise of technology and the changing landscape of the world, is creative art becoming a thing of the past?

With more and more people living their lives online, it’s no surprise that the demand for creative art is declining. With so much content available at our fingertips, it’s easy to see why many people are losing interest in buying paintings or going to concerts. With less demand, there’s also less money going into funding creative projects, which means we could see a decline in quality and quantity of art in the future.

That’s not to say that all hope is lost for creative art.

Discussing the definition of invention
Invention is a process of coming up with a new product or idea. This can be done through creative thinking, designing, or even just seeing an opportunity in the market and going for it. What makes something an invention? There are many different definitions out there, but the most common one is that it is a new idea that has not been tried before. So, if you come up with a new product or idea and you do not have any prior experience with it, you are considered an inventor.
