Definition: Innovation: the process or product of making a new and better version of an existing thing.
Innovation is the process or product of making a new and better version of an existing thing. It can refer to various aspects of technology, business, and creativity. Innovation often occurs when a company or individual discovers a new way to do something that earlier versions were unable to do. Additionally, innovation can come from the invention of a new product or idea. However, it is also possible for innovation to come from the development of a technology that was never before used in the industry. In both cases, innovation is a key factor in creating value for customers and shareholders alike.
