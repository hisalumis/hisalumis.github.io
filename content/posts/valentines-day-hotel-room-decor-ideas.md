Innovation is the process of coming up with new, better ways to do something. It can come from ideas, research, and development (R&D), or even from manufacturing or design. Innovation is often different than other types of innovation, such as creativity or efficiency.
Creativity is the process of coming up with new ideas that are different from what has been done before. It can come from brainstorming and poking around in your own mind, or from talking to others about what they have come up with. Innovation also comes from seeing things in a new way, whether it’s when you come up with a new product idea or when you fix an old one.
