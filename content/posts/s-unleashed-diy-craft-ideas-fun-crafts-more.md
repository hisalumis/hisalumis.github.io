What is brainstroming?
There is no one specific definition for brainstroming, but the phenomenon is typically defined as a state of high stress and anxiety caused by a combination of external factors (such as social media) and internal factors (such as personal thoughts or feelings). Brainstroming can be described as an intense feeling of focus, productivity, and clarity. It can be a great force for turning around projects and getting things done. However, it can also lead to feelings of stress, anxiety, and uncertainty. There are a few key steps you can take to reduce or avoid brainstroming: understand your triggers, set goals, and stay organized.

Different brainstorming techniques
When it comes to brainstorming, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. The best way to brainstorm depends on the situation and the type of project youâ€™re working on. Here are three different brainstorming techniques to try:
1. Brainwriting

Brainwriting is a great option when you need to generate a lot of ideas quickly. To brainwrite, each person in the group writes down their ideas on a piece of paper. Then, everyone passes their paper to the person next to them, who adds their own ideas. This continues until everyone has had a chance to add to all of the ideas.

2. Round Robin

The round robin technique is similar to brainwriting, but with one key difference: instead of passing around a piece of paper, each person takes turns verbally sharing their ideas with the group.
