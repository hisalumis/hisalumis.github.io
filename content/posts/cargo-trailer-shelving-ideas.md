Innovation: How do you create new products or services?
Invention ideas are something that can be created by anyone, and the process of coming up with them is often a collaborative effort. There are a variety of ways to come up with new products and services, but the best way to create something original is to think outside the box. Here are four tips for coming up with innovation ideas:
1. Be open to change: One of the most important things you can do when creating new products or services is to be flexible. If you’re not sure what you want your product or service to accomplish, be willing to experiment and see where things take you.

2. Be persistent: When it comes time to come up with new ideas, don’t give up easily. Keep looking for ways to improve your product or service until you find a way that works better than what you have currently in place.

The science of creativity
A person's creativity is often thought of as a mysterious quality that cannot be measured or studied. However, there is a growing body of research that suggests otherwise. The science of creativity is an interdisciplinary field that examines the nature and development of creative abilities.
While there is no single definition of creativity, it is generally defined as the ability to produce new and innovative ideas. Creativity is often seen as a rare or elusive quality, but recent research suggests that it is more common than previously thought.

There are many different factors that contribute to creativity. Some of these include intelligence, genes, environment, and motivation. However, one of the most important aspects of creativity is divergent thinking. This is the ability to come up with multiple solutions to a problem or multiple ways to approach a task.

defines what invention ideas are
The definition of an invention idea is up to the inventor. 
There are many different ways to create and patented inventions, so it is important to determine what type of invention you are thinking of creating. There are four main types of inventions: 
1) Product: A product is a physical object that a customer buys or uses. This could be anything from a new appliance to a new car. 
2) Process: This could be anything from baking soda to driving in rain. Inventions that improve or change the way products are made are often called process patents. 
3) Service: Service patents cover ideas that improve the service industry, such as making it easier for customers to find information or resolving problems faster. 
4) Technology: This could include anything from computers to air travel.
