What can be done to address them?
In recent years, there have been a number of proposals put forth to address the opioid epidemic. Some of these proposals include increasing access to treatment, distributing Narcan kits to civilians in need, and regulating prescription opioids. However, each proposal has its own set of challenges and limitations. Here are four examples:
1) Prescription opioids are highly addictive and can lead to addiction and death if not treated. 
2) The distribution of Narcan kits is difficult and often requires an affiliation with a specialty hospital or ambulance service. 
3) The regulation of prescription opioids is complex and often depends on the669 individual state laws. 
4) Addressing the opioid epidemic will require multiple strategies and interventions that work together.

Business: How do you make money from invention ideas?
If you're an inventor, there are a few things you need to keep in mind if you want to make some money from your invention ideas. 
First, it's important to come up with interesting and novel ideas that have potential market value. In order to get your idea accepted by the public, you'll need to supply clear evidence that your product or service is better than the competition.

Second, do your research before starting a business. Make sure you understand what kind of expenses associated with developing and selling your product or service and how much money you'll actually be making from each sale.

Finally, be prepared for long hours and plenty of travel (especially if your idea involves selling products or services online). This isn't easy work - but it's definitely worth it when it comes to making money from your invention ideas!
