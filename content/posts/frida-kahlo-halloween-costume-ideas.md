Ideas are one of the most important things in a person's life. Without ideas, there would be no point in living. There are many different types of ideas, but the most common ones are problems and solutions. People come up with ideas for everything from making money to fixing the world. Some people think that ideas are only good for coming up with new ways to do things, but that is not always true. Ideas can also be used to solve old problems or create new ones.

The power of big ideas
Big ideas are what drive innovation, creativity and success. They are the seeds of new thoughts and ideas that can change the course of a company or individual. Here, we explore four powerful ways to get big ideas in your head:
1. Get inspired by others: Take a look around you and see how others are able to come up with amazing solutions or new ideas. What do they do that you can't? Why did they do it that way and what were their results?

2. Adopt a principle: There's no need to be unique if you have a principle at the heart of your idea. Look for someone who has already done something great on this topic and copy their approach/methodology/mesurement/whatever it is.
