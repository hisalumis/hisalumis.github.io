How do we make sure that our technology helps us achieve our goals rather than hinder them?
Technology has a lot to offer in helping us achieve our goals, but it should be used responsibly. There are a number of ways technology can help us achieve our goals, but some are more harmful than others. Here are three examples: 
1. Technology can help us automate tasks and reduce the amount of time we have to spend on them. This can lead to decreased productivity and increased workloads. 
2. Technology can help us communicate with other people and devices more easily. This can lead to less communication and collaboration between team members. 
3. Technology can help us track our progress and organize our work more effectively. This can lead to better management of resources and improved productivity overall.
