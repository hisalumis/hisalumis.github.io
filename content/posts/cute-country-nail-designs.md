What are some 2020 ideas?
2020 is a year of opportunity. It's a time to think about what we can do to make our world a better place. Here are two ideas that could help: 
The first is the United Nations' " Agenda 21 ," which calls for creating an international body to focus on sustainable development. This would be a great way to bring together different groups of people who have something to say about how the world should be run, and it would also be a good way to learn from other countries. 
The second is the Global Compact on climate change, which was started in 2014 by more than 190 countries. The idea behind it is that all countries must take steps to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or less. This would mean reducing emissions from industries and buildings, improving energy efficiency, and investing in renewable energy sources.

There are many different types of creative art, but some of the most common are painting, sculpture, film, and music.
There are many different types of creative art, but some of the most common are painting, sculpture, film, and music. While there are many great artists out there who specialize in one type of creative art, it is important to have an understanding of what the different types of creativity can do for an artist. For example, if youâ€™re a painter and you want to create pieces featuring color and light, then you might use sculpture as your medium. However, if youâ€™re a sculptor and you want to create pieces that are dark and moody, then you might use painting as your medium. The point is that there is no one right way to do creative art - it all depends on the artist's preferences and what they're interested in doing.
