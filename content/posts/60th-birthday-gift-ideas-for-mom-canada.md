The rules of brainstorming.
1. Brainstorming is a process that can be used to generate ideas and solve problems.
2. There are some rules that should be followed when brainstorming, in order to make it more effective.

3. The first rule is to suspend judgment while ideas are being generated. This means that no idea should be immediately rejected, no matter how crazy it may seem at first.

4. The second rule is to allow for freewheeling association. This means that ideas should be generated without any restrictions, and any connections between ideas should be explored.

5. The third rule is to build on the ideas of others. This means that once an idea has been suggested, others should try to build on it and expand upon it.

6. The fourth rule is to record all of the ideas that are generated during the brainstorming session.

Invention is the process of coming up with a new and improved version of something. It can be something as simple as a new way to do something, or something more complex like building a machine that does not exist before. Inventions have had a profound impact on our society and the world around us. From devices used in everyday life such as lightbulbs and radios, to medical aids and advanced technology, inventions have made a difference in our lives.

The history of innovation
Innovation is not a new concept. It has been around since the beginning of time. The first instance of innovation was when early man used a sharpened rock to make a spear. This allowed him to kill animals for food and protect himself from predators. Since then, there have been many other instances of innovation.
The wheel is another example of innovation. It was invented by the Sumerians in Mesopotamia around 3500 BC. The wheel made it possible to transport goods and people over long distances. It also helped to speed up production in factories and workshops.

The printing press is another important invention that has had a major impact on the world. It was invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century and it made it possible to mass-produce books and other printed materials. This had a huge impact on education and knowledge sharing.
