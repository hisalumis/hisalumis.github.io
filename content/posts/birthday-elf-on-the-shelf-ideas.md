Invention 4: A new method of manufacturing a product or service
Invention ideas are the lifeblood of business. Without invention, businesses can't create new products or services that can compete with their competitors. The best way to find and explore invention ideas is by brainstorming with your team and come up with a few that you think could be successful. When you have a few good ideas, it's time to start refining them and coming up with concepts for products or services that could be new and exciting.

The future of invention: What implications do inventions have for the future?
Inventions are a cornerstone of the economy and society. They have the potential to completely change the way we live and work. They have the potential to make our lives easier, more comfortable, and more efficient. However, there are some implications of inventions that may not be immediately apparent. For example, some people might say that patents should be abolished because they give too much power to those who can create the most inventions. Others might say that innovations should be supported through government funding so that they can continue to grow and improve. In any case, it is important to consider what implications inventions may have for the future.
