The Benefits of a Blog
If you're looking for ways to improve your blog and make more money, then a blog is a great place to start. Not only can you share your thoughts and experiences with your audience, but you can also sell your content through advertising or affiliate programs. Here are some of the benefits of having a blog: 
1) You can build brand awareness: When people see your name and know who you are, they're more likely to visit your website or read your posts. This will help increase traffic and revenue, which will in turn help you pay bills, buy items online, or pay off debt. 
2) You can build relationships with readers: When you have an active blog community and engage with readers on a regular basis, you'll create a valuable connection that'll last longer.

Methodology: How will we test and measure the results?
Testing and measuring the results is an important step in any business. It allows you to know how your product or service is performing and whether it is meeting your expectations. There are many different ways to test and measure the results of a business, but one common approach is to use surveys. Surveys can be used to measure customer satisfaction, abandon rates, and more.
There are a few factors you should consider when choosing a survey technique. For example, do you want to target specific demographics? Or do you want to gather data from a large number of people? Finally, will you be able to release the results publicly? If so, public Release Testing (PRT) may be the best technique for you. PRT allows you to release your findings as soon as possible after testing so that everyone can see what worked and what didn’t.
