What are big ideas? What are some of the most important things to remember when it comes to big ideas?
There are a few important things to remember when it comes to big ideas. The first is that ideas should be focused and specific. If they're not, they'll likely never see the light of day. Second, it's important to have a plan for execution. This will help ensure that your idea actually happens, and doesn't just languish in your head. Finally, you need some backing from others before you can start anything truly big. Without this support, it's more difficult to truly push an idea off the ground.
