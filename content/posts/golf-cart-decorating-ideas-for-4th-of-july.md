The history of AI: How has AI been developed over the years?
A key part of any AI development is understanding the motivations behind the work. This history can be broken down into three periods: the1950s, 1970s, and 1980s. The 1950s were a time when AI was in its early developmental stages; however, it wasn’t until the 1960s that advancements began to occur in machine learning. However, this progress was slowed by two factors: the Cold War and concerns about how AI could be used for harm. The 1970s saw significant advancements made in AI; however, these advances were met with backlash from some quarters as they were seen as being too advanced for their time. The 1980s saw a shift towards using AI for good; however, this shift was met with criticism from some who felt that AI had become excessive in its power.

Concluding a brainstorming session can be just as important as starting one. Here are a few tips on how to effectively conclude a brainstorming session:
1. Thank everyone for their participation. This will help to foster a sense of team morale and keep people coming back to future sessions.

2. Summarize the main points that were discussed. This will help to ensure that everyone is on the same page and understands the goals of the session.

3. Choose one or two action items to focus on moving forward. This will help to keep the momentum going and ensure that progress is made on the goals that were set during the brainstorming session.

4. Assign someone to follow up on the action items. This will help to ensure that they get done in a timely manner and that everyone remains accountable for their part in achieving the goals.
