How innovation shapes our world
Innovation is the key to success in any industry. It allows businesses to create new products and services that stand out from the competition, and it drives down costs. In a world where innovation is so important, it's no wonder that companies arepushed to adopt it at all costs. However, while innovation can be a great thing, it can also have unintended consequences. For example, Starbucks today owes its success to its embrace of digital age coffee- drinking habits. However, if they hadn't embraced technology, their business might not have been as successful. In the same way, businesses must be careful not to overvalue innovation too much and stifle creativity. If done correctly, innovation can help businesses grow and change the world for the better.

How to have more ideas
The ability to have more ideas is a key skill for any entrepreneur or business person. However, not all ideas are equal and some may be better than others. To find the best ideas, it’s important to assess how well they align with your goals and objectives. Here are three tips on how to have more ideas:
1. Assessment: Without giving your idea too much thought, it’s natural to want to rush into anything without first assessing its potential risks and benefits. The first step in assessing an idea is to understand its key benefits and how they could impact your business or product. Once you know these things, you can determine if the idea has potential for success.
