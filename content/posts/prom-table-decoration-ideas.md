The Process of Invention: What goes into creating a new invention?
Invention can be defined as the process by which a new idea, product or service is created. It starts with the seed of an idea and ends with the final product or service. Key ingredients in the process of invention include creativity, problem solving and collaboration. The process can be time-consuming and expensive, but when it works well it can be exhilarating. Here are four tips for putting your best foot forward when creating a new invention: 1. Take your time – don’t rush your Invention. Even if it takes a little longer than you’d like, taking your time will help you stay organized and focused on your project. 2. Be open to feedback – Get feedback from potential customers, employees or others who may have an impact on how your Invention turns out.

The Best Ideas: What are the best ideas?
Creative ideas are always a great way to get things started and can help you solve problems. Here are some of the best ideas on how to start working on your projects: 
1. Start with a blank slate: This is definitely one of the most popular ideas and can be used for both creative and everyday tasks. Create a list of ideas and then use them as a starting point for your next project. 
2. Take risks: When it comes to creativity, there’s no guarantee that everything will work out, but doing something new and risky can be a great way to get started. If something doesn’t work out, don’t be afraid to give up–you can always try again later. 
3. Collaborate: Collaborating with other people is another great way to get started on your projects.
