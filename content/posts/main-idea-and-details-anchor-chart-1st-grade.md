It's been said that ideas are like pails of water - you fill them up with as many different thoughts and concepts as you can, and then see where they take you. That's what happens when you have a great idea. You start thinking about ways to make it a reality, and then the possibilities start opening up. There's no one answer to whether or not an idea is successful, but it's always worth trying out different approaches to see what works best for you.
