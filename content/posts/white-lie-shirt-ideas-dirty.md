    Ideas can be anything and everything. They can be new ways of looking at an old problem, or new ways to approach an old one. They can be a way to think about something that you've never thought of before, or a way to come up with a solution to a problem that you've never even contemplated. Ideas are the lifeblood of creativity, and without them, we might just as well give up.

What are the benefits of coming up with big ideas?
When it comes to ideas, there are a number of benefits that come with creating them. From improving communication and team morale to coming up with new and innovative ways of doing business, big ideas can have a huge impact on both individuals and companies. Here are four reasons why: 
1. They can open up new possibilities: When a group of people have a good idea, it can be difficult to resist trying out what they've come up with. This allows for increased creativity as well as ingenuity, which can lead to new and innovative solutions. 

2. They can spark inspiration: Ideas are often based on something that someone else has already done or experienced.

The power of big ideas
There are certain ideas that have the power to change the world. These are the big ideas. And while some people may think that only governments and large organizations have the ability to enact change on a global scale, history has shown us time and again that it is often the power of an individual with a big idea that can make the biggest difference.
One person with a big idea can start a movement that changes the way we think about an issue or problem. We’ve seen it happen with civil rights, women’s rights, and environmental issues. It is one person who has the courage to stand up and say “this is wrong” or “this needs to change” who can start a chain reaction that leads to real and lasting change.
