Creative Ways To Spice Up Your Life
Creative ways to add some extra spice to your life can be both fun and helpful. Here are a few ideas: 
1. Get creative with your home décor. Use bright, fun colors and styles to make your living space more interesting and inviting. This can include adding new pieces of art, updating the decor or adding accessories like rugs or curtains to give the room a fresh look. 
2. Experiment with different relaxation techniques. Sometimes all you need is some time alone to relax and clear your mind. Try some yoga, meditation or aromatherapy treatments to help you do just that. 
3. Take on a new challenge. Whether it’s taking on a new job or learning a new skill, there are always opportunities for creativity and growth when given the freedom to explore them in an outside environment.

New Directions: What options do these new ideas offer?
A new approach to mental health— called Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)—offers hope for a brighter future for those struggling with depression and other mental health conditions.
MBSR is a mindfulness-based stress reduction program that was created in the 1990s by Dr. Richard Davidson and Dr. Peter Salovey. It has since been used in clinical settings to help reduce stress and improve mental health, including reducing depression symptoms.

The program is based on the idea that when people are able to be present with their thoughts, feelings, and environment, they can better manage their own emotions and relationships. MBSR is also known for its ability to improve physical health by increasing overall well-being and decreasing stress levels.
