The role of innovation in business: How important is innovation in business?
Innovation is key to any business. Without innovation, businesses would not be able to compete in the marketplace. Innovation also helps businesses succeed in the long run by creating new ideas and concepts that can be turned into successful products or services. There are a number of different ways innovation can help businesses succeed, but one of the most important methods is through creativity. By coming up with new ideas that are not commonly thought of and working on them until they become a reality, businesses are more likely to succeed than if they just stick to what is common wisdom.

History of innovation: How has it been used and abused in the past?
The history of innovation is filled with examples of it being used and abused. In the past, innovation has been used to improve efficiency, increase production, decrease costs, and create new products. However, these same advantages can also be abused if not Properly managed.

Innovation can be abused when it is used for unoriginal or unwanted purposes. For example, in the early 1900srialist countries like Russia used innovation to produce innovative Catherine the Great cars while developing other technologies behind the scenes which led to their rise to power. By doing this, they were able to stay afloat during a time where other countries were struggling. However, this practice resulted in Russian technology becoming outdated and eventually lost its competitive edge. 

Similarly, in China during the late 1990s there was a large focus on artificial intelligence (AI) as part of efforts to modernize their economy.
