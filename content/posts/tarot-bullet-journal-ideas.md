Definition of innovation: The process of coming up with a new, original idea or product.
Innovation is the process of coming up with a new, original idea or product. Innovation can come in many forms, but it's most commonly used when someone comes up with a new way to do something. Innovation can be seen as the result of ideas and exploration, as well as the courage to take risks. For example, Apple was able to come up with the iPhone thanks to their innovation. In order for innovation to work, there must be a clear vision and an understanding of what people want and need. This requires creativity and risk-taking, both of which are something that often isn't easy to find in most businesses.

Overcoming Obstacles to Inventing
Inventing is often hailed as the key to success, but it's not always easy to come up with new ideas. Here are some tips for overcoming obstacles and generating invention ideas.
1. Brainstorm with a group of people. Collaboration can help spark new ideas and help you see problems from different angles.

2. Take inspiration from other inventors. Study how they came up with their groundbreaking ideas and try to apply those same methods to your own thinking.

3. Be persistent and don't give up.Search for solutions until you find one that works for you. Inventing is often a trial-and-error process, so don't be discouraged if your first few attempts fail.
