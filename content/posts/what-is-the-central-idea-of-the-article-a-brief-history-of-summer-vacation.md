Creative process: What are the four steps?
Creative process is key to any creative endeavors. There are four steps that go into creating a masterpiece: 1) Defining the problem or goal. This will help you come up with a strong plan of how you will solve the problem, 2) Crafting the solution or idea. This can be done through brainstorming, exploring different options, and formulating a proposal. 3) Testing and refining the solution or idea. This can involve working on it for hours, weekends, or even weeks until it’s ready for submission to an audience. 4) Sending the solution or idea off to be created by others. Once it’s created by someone else, it needs to be edited, improved upon, and finalized before being published online or as a final product.
