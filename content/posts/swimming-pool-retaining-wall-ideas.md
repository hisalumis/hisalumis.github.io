The future of work: What will be the biggest changes in work in 2022?
Work in the future will be much more flexible and customizable. More work could be done remotely and on devices that are always with us. This would make work more enjoyable and less physical. There will also be a shift to contract work, where people are hired for a specific duration of time, rather than being employed for the indefinite period of time.
