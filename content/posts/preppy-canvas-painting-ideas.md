The Future of Housing: How will technology change housing and homelessness?
Technology is already changing many aspects of our everyday lives, from how we shop to how we cook. It could soon change the way we live and work too, with implications for housing and homelessness. This article will explore some of the possibilities. 
One idea is that technology could help to create more affordable housing by providing a more accurate representation of what people actually need and want in their homes. Another possibility is that it could help individuals or groups who are homeless or at risk of homelessness to find new homes, either through advertizing or directly working with landlords. 

All of these ideas are just starting to be considered, and there are still many questions remaining about how they will be implemented. However, if done correctly, these changes could have positive impacts on both individuals and groups who need housing but don't currently have it.

The Aftermath of Creativity: What happens to creativity after itâ€™s completed?
Creativity is a natural and essential part of many people s lives. It can be used to create new ideas, or to explore old ones. But what happens to creativity once it s completed?
There are a few factors that can affect the quality of creativity after it s complete. The first is whether or not the creative person has received enough feedback. If they haven t, they may not have been able to improve their ideas or come up with new ways to approach problems. The second factor is the intensity of the creative process itself. If it s gentle, nurturing, and doesn t require any hard work or effort on the part of the creator, then they may be more likely to maintain their creative Passions for life. But if the creative process is strenuous and demanding, then they may not be as inspired again as soon as they once were.
