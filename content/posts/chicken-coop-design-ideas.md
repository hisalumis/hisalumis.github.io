Definition of creativity: Pixar's Bob Crandall said "Creativity is the ability to go beyond what you expected."
In an industry where creativity is often measured in terms of output, Pixar's Bob Crandall said that creativity is the ability to go beyond what you expected. This definition has helped the animation studio create some of the most innovative and groundbreaking films in history, including Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and Ratatouille.
While it may be a cliché to say that creativity comes from the ability to think outside the box, Crandall's definition actually provides a more accurate definition for what makes creative individuals successful. By understanding how creativity works, businesses can better define their own goals and strategies for becoming more creative.

The role of invention in innovation: What benefits can it bring to businesses?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new design, product or service that is different from those currently in use. It can have a number of benefits for businesses, including increasing efficiency and saving time. For example, the discovery of a new vaccine could lead to saved lives and reduced TB cases. There are also plenty of other examples where innovation can have significant impacts on businesses. For example, the development of new transportation methods could lead to increased efficiency in travel or the development of new materials that can improve quality control processes.
