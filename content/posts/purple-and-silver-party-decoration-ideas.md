what is creative art?
Creative art is a form of expression that utilizes one or more creative mediums to convey feelings, thoughts, or ideas. The world of creative art is vast and ever-changing, making it one of the most dynamic and exciting areas of human endeavor.
There are countless forms of creative art, each with its own unique purpose and audience. Whether it’s a painting hung in a gallery or a performance piece staged in front of an audience, creative art has the power to provoke emotion and inspire thought.

At its core, creative art is about communication. It’s a way for artists to share their vision with the world, and for audiences to connect with the artist on a deeper level. Whether you’re creating art or simply enjoying it, remember that it has the ability to touch us all in ways that words alone can never hope to achieve.

Creative ideas are aplenty, but sometimes they don't come easy. You have to be willing to think outside the box and come up with new ways to do things. Here are some ways to come up with creative ideas: 
1. Take on a new project: This can be something as small as creating a new design for your business cards or as large as starting your own business. It doesn't have to be anything that you're exclusively good at – it could be something that you're curious about and haven't tried before. Everything counts! 
2. Lead an experiment: One of the best ways to come up with creative ideas is to lead an experiment. This means starting off by thinking about what you're not doing and trying something different instead.
