Lessons learned from innovation: What have been some of the most successful implementations?
Innovation is a process of making something better. In technology, innovation often refers to the birth of new products or technologies, or the alteration of a design to make it more efficient, effective, or user-friendly.

Setting up and running your own blog can be a daunting task, but with some thoughtful planning and execution it can be a rewarding experience. Here are three tips to help you get started:
