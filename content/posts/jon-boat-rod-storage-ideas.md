Invention: How does innovation happen?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new way to do something. Sometimes, this comes about through the sharing of ideas or the discovery of a new resource. Sometimes, it comes about through the development of a new product or service.
In any case, innovation happens in many ways and at different speeds. Here are four examples that illustrate how: 

1) Invention often happens spontaneously - people will often come up with ideas for new products or services while they are still working on other projects. 
2) Invention can be slow - sometimes it takes years for someone to develop a new product or service that is really useful. 
3) Invention can be fast - sometimes people can come up with ideas for products and services in minutes or even seconds.

The power of creativity
Creativity is a key part of many businesses and individuals. It can be used to come up with new ideas, create products or services, and solve problems. However, creativity can also be abused. It can be used to come up with ways to make money that are not sustainable, or to simply ignore the needs of others in order to pursue your own desires. However, there are some powerful things that come with creativity. For example, creativity can help people find solutions to problems they may have never thought of before, or it can help you create something that is truly unique and amazing. so if you want to harness the power of creative thinking and use it for the good of yourself and others, then you need to learn how to use it!
