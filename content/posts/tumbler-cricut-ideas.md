The Process of Creating an Idea: How do you come up with an idea?
There are a few key steps in the process of coming up with an idea. You need to come up with a good idea, determine what it is, and then come up with a way to make it a reality. There are many ways to create an idea, but the most important part is that you come up with something that you can stand behind. If you don't have any proof or if your idea isn't feasible, your chances of success are much lower. So, go through the steps above and make sure that everything is on point before starting to develop your idea.

Contemporary Inventions: The computer, the internet, 3D printing
Invention is the key to progress. It is what takes us from the horse and buggy to the automobile, from telegraphs to telephones, from mainframe computers to laptops. And it is what has given us 3D printing, a technology that has the potential to change manufacturing as we know it.
3D printing is an additive manufacturing process, which means that it builds objects by adding layers of material one at a time. This is in contrast to subtractive manufacturing processes like CNC machining, which involve cutting away material to create an object.

3D printing has been around for decades, but it has only recently become accessible to consumers and small businesses. Thanks to advances in 3D printer technology and the availability of affordable 3D printers, this transformative technology is now within reach of anyone with an idea and a bit of creativity.
