How to have more creative ideas: methods for improving your creativity
If you're looking for ways to be more creative, try these methods:
1. Get organized. This may seem counter-intuitive, but being organized can actually help you be more creative. When everything is in its place, you can focus your energy on generating new ideas instead of wasting time looking for things.

2. Take breaks. Sometimes the best way to come up with new ideas is to take a break from whatever you're working on. Go for a walk, take a nap or just step away from your work to clear your head. You may be surprised at how refreshed and ready to think creatively you feel when you return to your project.

3. Be open to new ideas. If you want to have more creative ideas, it's important to be open to hearing them from others.
