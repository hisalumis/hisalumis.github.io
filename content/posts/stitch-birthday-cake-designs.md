The Relationship of Invention to Technology: What makes an invention useful?
Invention is the process of creating a new product or service from scratch. However, Invention can also bedefined as the creation of a new way of doing something, whether it’s in the realm of technology or business. Inventions have revolutionized how we live, work and interact with the world around us. They have also allowed for advancements in technology that we could never have thought possible. 
However, there are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to Invention. First, Invention has to be useful- if it’s not, it won’t be adopted by society as quickly as some inventions have. Second, Invention has to be affordable- if it’s too expensive or difficult to create a working prototype, people will not adopt it.
