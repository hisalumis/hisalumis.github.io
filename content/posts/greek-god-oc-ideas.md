Brainstorming Methods: Different ways to brainstorm invention ideas.
1. When it comes to brainstorming invention ideas, there are a variety of different methods you can use.
2. One popular method is called "brainstorming by association." This involves coming up with ideas by associating them with other words or concepts.
3. Another common method is called "freewriting." This involves simply writing down whatever comes to mind, without worrying about whether it makes sense or not.
4. If you're having trouble getting started, try brainstorming with a group of friends or colleagues. You may be surprised at how quickly the ideas start flowing when you're working with others.
5. Whatever method you choose, the important thing is to keep the ideas flowing. Don't worry about whether they're good or bad at first, just get them down on paper (or in a computer file). You can always edit them later.

Aims and objectives of creativity: What are they, and how do they differ from those of other art forms?
Creativity is the ability to come up with ideas and concepts that are unrelated to what is currently on the surface. It can be found in all forms of art, but creativity in particular revolves around the idea of composition orlayout. In creative art, the aim is to create something that is unique and different from anything else in the world. Other forms of art may have specific objectives such as teaching or promoting a message, but creativity has no set boundaries.
