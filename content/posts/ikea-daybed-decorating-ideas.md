New ideas and how to find them: What factors do you need to consider?
Are you looking for new ideas to improve your business? If so, there are a few things you need to consider. Here are some factors to consider:
1) What is your target market? Are you targeting new customers or existing ones? 
2) What are your goals? Are you looking to grow or remain profitable? 
3) How can you reach your target market? Do you have a website or marketing strategy in place? 
4) How will your products and services meet the needs of your target market? Will you create a unique selling proposition or copy that stands out from the competition?
