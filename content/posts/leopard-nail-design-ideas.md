How to come up with great big ideas
Big ideas can be a really fun way to get your creative juices flowing. Here are some tips on how to come up with great big ideas. 
1. Get organized: When you have a lot of ideas, it can be hard to decide which ones to work on. One way to make this process easier is to create a list of main points or topics that you want to cover. From there, you can break each one down into smaller pieces and start working on those that seem the most interesting and important. 

2. Be open to change: It’s rare that something will stay the same for very long in life. Sometimes what seemed like an easy idea at first might not be as difficult as we thought it would be after further thought. This is where being open to change comes in handy.

What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas can be a big help when it comes to solving problems. Ideas can also help you see things in a new light or come up with new ideas for projects. There are many benefits to having ideas and some people swear by the power of them. Here are three reasons why you should try out ideas at least once: 
- When you have an idea, it can force you to think about what else could be done. This can lead to new ideas, which in turn can lead to new projects. 
- Ideas are often more efficient than what is currently being done. When you have an idea, you can get started on it even if it’s not perfect and that makes the process of learning more efficient. 
- Ideas give people the opportunity to share their thoughts and opinions with others.
