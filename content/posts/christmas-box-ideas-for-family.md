The Key: What are the essential steps in the creative process?
Creative ideas are like seeds. They can be sown in any direction, but they will eventually germinate and produce a flower. The key to success when it comes to creative ideas is to have a clear plan for how you want the idea to turn into a reality. Once you have a good Idea, the next step is to come up with specific details that will make it real. You need to know what your target market is, what your competition is, and what your goals are.
