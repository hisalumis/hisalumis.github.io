abstract art: When did this type of art become popular?
Art has been around for centuries, but it wasn’t until the 1800s that abstract art became popular. Abstract art is created without any specific reference or meaning. It can be seen as one of the newer forms of art, and it has become increasingly popular in recent years. There are many different reasons why abstract art is becoming more popular, but one of the most important factors is its ability to convey a message or idea through its design.

What are big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are many dimensions to consider. These can be broken down into four categories: problem, solution, opportunity and impact. 
Problem: How can we make our world a better place? 
Solution: There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question; each person's perspective and situation will dictate the best way to solve a problem. However, there are a few general concepts that can be used in order to determine what type of solution may work best for a given situation. One such concept is called the "Golden Rule." This states that you should do what is right, even if it doesn't make sense at first. 

Opportunity: What are the possible consequences of our actions? 

Impact: What kind of change or impact will our solutions have?
