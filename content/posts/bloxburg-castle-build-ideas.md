What is brainstroming?
Brainstroming is a mental activity that occurs when a person is focused on one thing and does not have other thoughts or concerns running through their minds. Brainstroming can be beneficial to someone, as it can help them to focus on a task and stay organized.

Defining "big ideas"
What are "big ideas"? This is a question that has been asked throughout the history of education. The answer, however, is not always so clear.
One way to think of big ideas is as concepts that are essential for understanding a particular subject. For example, in mathematics, some big ideas include numbers and operations, patterns and relationships, and geometry and measurement. In science, some big ideas include energy and matter, waves and forces, and Earth and space.

The National Education Association's College and Career Readiness Standards also identify several big ideas in each content area. For example, in English Language Arts, the standards identify reading for knowledge and information; reading for literary experience; writing; speaking and listening; and language. In history/social studies, the standards identify civics and government; economics; geography; history;and social studies skills and methods.

Although creativity is often thought of as a tool that can be used for good, it can also be used to create harmful or negative ideas. For example, someone who is creative may come up with a new way to cook an egg, but if this person then starts to eat eggs out of the frying pan every day, they may begin to develop an egg-eating disorder.

The Role of Innovation in the Future of Business: What will be the most significant changes in the future as a result of innovation?
Innovation is a key part of the future of business. It allows businesses to make new products and services that can be sold to customers and increase profits. But with innovation comes risk, which can lead to new products or services not being successful and costing more than those that were initially created. Innovation also requires time and money, which can be difficult to come by in some cases.
But while innovation may be a necessary part of the future of business, it is not always easy to come by. In some cases, companies have to invest in researching and developing new ideas for products or services in order to bring them to market quickly. This takes time, money, and effort ‚Äì all of which may not be available in other times or situations.

So while innovation may not always be easy to come by, it is an essential part of the future of business.
