Different brainstorming techniques
When it comes to brainstorming, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. The best way to brainstorm depends on the situation and the type of project you’re working on. Here are three different brainstorming techniques to try:
1. Brainwriting

Brainwriting is a great option when you need to generate a lot of ideas quickly. To brainwrite, each person in the group writes down their ideas on a piece of paper. Then, everyone passes their paper to the person next to them, who adds their own ideas. This continues until everyone has had a chance to add to all of the ideas.

2. Round Robin

The round robin technique is similar to brainwriting, but with one key difference: instead of passing around a piece of paper, each person takes turns verbally sharing their ideas with the group.

6) Find a way to offer help or inspiration to others
There are many people out there who need help, and even more people who need inspiration. It can be difficult to know what to do or say in order to offer them both. Here are six ideas for how you could help someone who needs it: 
1. Graphics: Draw a picture or write down a description of the problem or situation that the person is experiencing. This will provide some insight and direction for providing help. 
2. Words of Wisdom: Share your own experiences and advice with the person in question, or recommend books, articles, etc., that can help them out. This will give the person something to look forward to and may also inspire them further. 
3. Opinion: Share your thoughts on what the person should do or how they should go about solving their problem.
