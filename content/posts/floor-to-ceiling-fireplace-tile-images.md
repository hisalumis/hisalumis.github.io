Conclusion: Why is invention so important?
Invention has been a vital part of human history and economy for centuries. It allows people to create new products and services that they can sell and improve their lives. Inventions have also helped keep our society running smoothly, as well as protecting the environment.
So why is invention so important? There are many reasons, but one of the most important is that it helps us solve problems. Inventions allow us to make things that we wouldn’t be able to make on our own, or design things that we would never have thought possible. They also help us avoid potential disasters, like the Space Race.

 Invention is an essential part of our society and economy because it allows people to improve their lives and protect the environment. We should continue to be inspired by what inventors have done in order to keep society running smoothly and protect the environment.
