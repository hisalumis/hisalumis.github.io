Creative ideas are nothing new to us, but they can be found in a variety of forms. Sometimes they come from simple things, like when someone comes up with a new way to do something, or when someone comes up with an innovative solution to a problem. Other times, creative ideas come from more complex solutions that require some extra thought and effort. But no matter what the form, creativity is always welcome and appreciated.

Conclusion: Summarize the main points of the article.
Invention is the process of creating something new. It can be an idea, a product, a service, or a process. Inventors are people who create new things. They have inventive minds and are always looking for ways to improve upon what already exists.
The invention process involves four main steps: ideation, development, prototype testing, and commercialization. Ideation is the stage in which an inventor comes up with an idea for a new product or service. Development is the stage in which the inventor turns the idea into a plan and begins to create a prototype. Prototype testing is the stage in which the prototype is put to the test to see if it works as intended. Commercialization is the stage in which the invention is made available to consumers.

Inventions can be either big or small.
