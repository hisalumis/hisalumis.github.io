The 4 Cs of Ideas: What are they, and what do they mean for your business?
Ideas are a powerful tool for businesses. They can help them to focus, think outside the box, and come up with new ideas that can improve their operations or products. But like all tools, they have a price. Here are four tips on how to use ideas properly in your business:
1. Find the right idea: idea selection is key to success when it comes to coming up with new products, services, or solutions. You need to find something that has potential but hasn't been done before, something that could be of value to your customers or yourself.

2. Make sure your idea is worth consideration: Once you've chosen an idea, you need to make sure it's worth pursuing. If it's not something people are interested in or it doesn't have a lot of potential market potential, you'll likely be unsuccessful in bringing it to life.

There are many benefits to big ideas, including increased creativity, innovation, and productivity. However, there are also a few key considerations that should be taken into account when creating big ideas. Here are four tips to help you create better big ideas:
