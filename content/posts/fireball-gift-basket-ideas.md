The history and definition of creative art: From the ancient Greeks to the 20th century
There is no one definition of creative art that can encompass everything that may be considered creative. However, the term “creative” has been used to refer to various activities throughout history. From ancient Greeks to the 20th century, there have been many different definitions of what creativity means. However, one common definition of creativity is “the ability to produce something new and original.” This definition encompasses a wide range of activities, from creating works of art to coming up with new ideas for products or services.
One example of creativity in the ancient Greeks was the use of artistic creation in order to communicate messages. The artist was often used as a medium for discussing important concepts such as justice and morality. The Ancient Greeks also believed that music and dance could be used as forms of creativity in order to express themselves.

The future of inventions: What needs to be done in order for new inventions to thrive?
Inventions have always been a part of humanity’s history, but as the world has become more complex, so too has the need for new inventions. This is especially true in today’s world, where technology is constantly evolving and becoming more advanced. In order for new inventions to thrive, however, there are several key things that need to be done. 
One of the most important things that needs to be done is to make sure that new inventions are passed on from one generation to the next. This can be done by creating a system where people can share ideas for new inventions with each other, and then testing and dubbing them into products or services. It also helps to create a market for these products or services by attracting investors who can help to bring these products or services to market quickly.
