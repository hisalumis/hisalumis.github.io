Conclusion: What are some successful inventions?
Inventions are often the products of individuals who come up with an idea for a new product or service, and then go on to make it a reality. Some famous inventions include the transistor, the Apollo 11 moon landing, and the iPhone. The list goes on and on, but it is important to think about what made some of these inventions successful – from the innovative design to the marketing that helped them sell out. Here are six examples of successful inventions that you may have never heard of:
1. The television set: George Martin invented Television in 1928 and introduced it into homes across Great Britain in 1930. The TV set has become one of the most popular devices in history, with over 150 million units sold worldwide.

2. Laser pointer: Sheldon Whitehead developed Laser pointers in 1958 and they became very popular among students and other members of the public.

Invention as an act or process: What are some examples?
There are many examples of Invention as an act or process. Sometimes people invent things just because they think they can and sometimes people invent things to help others. Inventors often have a vision for what they want their invention to be, and they work towards making that vision a reality. Some examples of Invention include: 
1) Wiring diagrams: Many inventions are born of need, like the Telephone. Mechanical engineers had been working on creating electrical wiring diagrams for centuries before Alexander Graham Bell came up with the idea for theTelephone.
2) The computer: Inventions like the transistor and laser were all born from necessity - computers did not exist until after WWII because scientists could not build them on a large scale.
3) The airplane: Wright brothers flew airplanes in 1903 without any assistance from anyone else!
