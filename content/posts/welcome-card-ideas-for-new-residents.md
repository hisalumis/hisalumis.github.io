Creativity is often thought of as a natural ability that is innate in some people. However, the origins of creativity may be more complex than that. There are multiple theories about how creativity developed, and it's still an open question for scientists and philosophers alike. One theory suggests that creativity may have arisen from the need to solve problems. Another theory suggests that creativity may come from the need to find new ways to do things. There are many possible explanations for why creativity exists, and it'll continue to be a mystery until further research is done.
